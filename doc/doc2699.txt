£150

The £300 travel cost that the consultant recharges to the client is not a disbursement so the consultant must charge VAT on it. But the cost of the website hosting package is a disbursement and can be excluded from the VAT calculation, because:

it was purchased for the use of the client

the client agreed that the consultant would arrange and pay for it on their behalf - this means the consultant agreed to act as the client’s agent

the consultant passed the whole £150 charge on to the client, without adding anything, as a separate item on the invoice

it was the client’s responsibility to pay for the goods

the consultant had permission from his client to make the payment
