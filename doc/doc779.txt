Overview

You can appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (Tax) if you want to challenge some decisions by:

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)

Border Force

the National Crime Agency (NCA)

the Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA)

The tribunal is independent of the government, HMRC, Border Force, NCA and WRA, and it will listen to both sides of the argument before making a decision.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Appeal an HMRC decision

You can appeal against most decisions about ‘direct tax’ and ‘indirect tax’.

Direct tax includes:
