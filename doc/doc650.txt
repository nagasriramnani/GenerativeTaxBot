Selling overseas property

Work out your gain

Your gain is usually the difference between what you paid for your property and the amount you got when you sold (or ‘disposed of’) it.

If your combined capital gains are over your allowance for the year you’ll have to report and pay Capital Gains Tax.

Market value

In some situations you should use the market value of the property when working out your gain. Do this if:

it was a gift (there are different rules if it was to your spouse, civil partner or a charity)

you sold it for less than it was worth to help the buyer

you inherited it (and do not know the Inheritance Tax value)

you owned it before April 1982
