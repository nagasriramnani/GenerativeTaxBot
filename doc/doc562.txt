If the asset, such as land or property, was owned as a joint tenant with the person’s spouse or civil partner, divide the value of the asset by 2.

If land or property was owned with other joint tenants, for example friends or siblings, do both of the following:

divide the value by the number of owners

take 10% from the share of the person who died

Example

The deceased owned a property as a joint tenant with 3 other people. The property is worth £200,000 on the date they died, giving them a £50,000 share (£200,000 divided by 4).

After 10% (£5,000) is deducted from the deceased’s £50,000 share, the final value is £45,000 (£50,000 - £5,000 = £45,000).
