When you report a disposal, you need to include a computation of your taxable gains and losses along with your return. If you choose to defer payment for a property sold up to 5 April 2020, the computation should be included with your relevant Self Assessment return and payment made as part of your normal end of year payment.

Use a tax agent or adviser

To give HMRC limited authorisation to deal directly with your agent or adviser, email: non-residentcgt.spt@hmrc.gov.uk

Limited authorisation means this authorisation only applies to matters concerning non-residents Capital Gains Tax up to 5 April 2020 and not to the Capital Gains Tax on UK property account.
