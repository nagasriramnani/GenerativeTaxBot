interest on savings over your savings allowance

You do not pay tax on things like:

the first £1,000 of income from self-employment - this is your ‘trading allowance’

the first £1,000 of income from property you rent (unless you’re using the Rent a Room Scheme)

income from tax-exempt accounts, like Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) and National Savings Certificates

dividends from company shares under your dividends allowance

some state benefits

premium bond or National Lottery wins

rent you get from a lodger in your house that’s below the rent a room limit

If you only occasionally sell items or rent out property (for example through auction websites or short-term rental apps), check if you need to tell HMRC about this income.
