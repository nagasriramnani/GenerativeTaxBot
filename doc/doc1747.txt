Income over £100,000

Your Personal Allowance goes down by £1 for every £2 that your adjusted net income is above £100,000. This means your allowance is zero if your income is £125,140 or above.

You’ll also need to do a Self Assessment tax return.

If you do not usually send a tax return, you need to register by 5 October following the tax year you had the income.

Register for Self Assessment

You’ll get a letter telling you what to do next after you’ve registered.
