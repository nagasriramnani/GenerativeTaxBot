Contact the claims company with your complaint so they have a chance to put things right.

Keep a record of your complaint, for example details about any communication between you and the claims company.

Contact the Financial Ombudsman Service if your claims company does not resolve your complaint in 8 weeks.

Complaining about poor conduct

Complain to the FCA if you’re unhappy with the conduct of a claims company.

Poor conduct could include:

breaking the conduct rules for claims companies

unsolicited calls or texts - find out how to stop or reduce them

not being registered on the financial services register

The FCA cannot pay compensation or order a claims management company to compensate you, even if you’ve received poor service.
