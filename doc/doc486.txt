If you make Self Assessment ‘payments on account’

Tell HMRC if you expect a big decrease in income and you pay your Self Assessment tax bill in advance (‘payments on account’). HMRC may decide to reduce your payments.

After you tell HMRC

HMRC may:

change your tax code and send you a PAYE Coding notice

tell you to send a Self Assessment tax return so they can bill you for tax you owe

send you a refund if you paid too much tax
