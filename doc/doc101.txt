Penalty

If you’ve appealed against a penalty you will not have to pay until your appeal has been settled.

Indirect tax

If you’ve asked HMRC to review an indirect tax decision, for example VAT or Insurance Premium Tax, you will not need to pay until the review has finished.

If you appeal to the tax tribunal you’ll usually have to pay the tax before they will hear your appeal. You can ask to delay paying the tax if it would cause you extreme financial difficulty (for example, bankruptcy or liquidation).

Once a final decision has been reached, you must pay any money that you owe in full including interest.

Penalty
