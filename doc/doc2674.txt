Your installer charges you a total of £1000 (excluding VAT) for installation – £400 for the materials and £600 for the labour. This means the value of the materials (£400) is only 40% of the total cost of installation (£1000). Your installer can charge you the reduced rate of 5% VAT on the total installation cost.

Example - solar panels and battery materials are more than 60% of the total cost of installation
