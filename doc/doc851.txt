Write your 11-character payment reference on the back of the cheque. This is your 10-digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) followed by the letter ‘K’. You’ll find the reference number on the paying-in slip.

HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it, and not the date it reaches their account (as long as you pay from Monday to Friday).
