A pension worth up to £30,000 that includes a defined benefit pension

If you have £30,000 or less in all of your private pensions, you can usually take everything you have in your defined benefit pension or defined contribution pension as a ‘trivial commutation’ lump sum. If you take this option, 25% is tax-free.

If this lump sum is paid from more than one pension, you must:

have your savings in each scheme valued by the provider on the same day, no more than 3 months before you get the first payment

get all payments within 12 months of the first payment

If you take payments from a pension before taking the rest as a lump sum, you pay tax on the whole lump sum.
