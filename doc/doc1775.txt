HMRC Inheritance Tax

Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’.

Write the name of the deceased and your Inheritance Tax payment reference number on the back of the cheque. You’ll find the reference number on the letter HMRC sent you.

HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it and not the date it reaches HMRC’s account, if you pay between Monday and Friday.
