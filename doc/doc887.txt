If you’re not UK resident, you will not have to pay UK tax on your foreign income.

If you’re UK resident, you’ll normally pay tax on your foreign income. But you may not have to if your permanent home (‘domicile’) is abroad.

Reporting foreign income

If you need to pay tax, you usually report your foreign income in a Self Assessment tax return. But there’s some foreign income that’s taxed differently.

If your income is taxed in more than one country

You may be able to claim tax relief if you’re taxed in more than one country.

If you’ve not yet paid tax on the foreign income, you may need to apply for a certificate of residence to prove you’re eligible for relief.
