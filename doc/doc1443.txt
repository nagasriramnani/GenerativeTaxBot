If you're taxed twice

You may be taxed on your UK income by the country where you’re resident and by the UK.

You may not have to pay twice if the country you’re resident in has a ‘double-taxation agreement’ with the UK. Depending on the agreement, you can apply for either:

partial or full relief before you’ve been taxed

a refund after you’ve been taxed

Each double-taxation agreement sets out:

the country you pay tax in

the country you apply for relief in

how much tax relief you get
