If you’re not sure if this applies to you, read the guidance on non-established-taxable-persons (NETPs).

You can choose to register for VAT if your turnover is less than £85,000 (‘voluntary registration’).

You must pay HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) any VAT you owe from the date they register you.

If everything you sell is exempt from VAT, you do not have to register for VAT.

If you exceeded the threshold in the last 12 months

You must register if, by the end of any month, your total VAT taxable turnover for the last 12 months was over £85,000.

You have to register within 30 days of the end of the month when you went over the threshold. Your effective date of registration is the first day of the second month after you go over the threshold.
