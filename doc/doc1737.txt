Temporary imports

You can usually use a vehicle with foreign number plates without registering or taxing it in the UK if all of the following apply:

youâ€™re visiting and do not plan to live here

the vehicle is registered and taxed in its home country

you only use the vehicle for up to 6 months in total - this can be a single visit, or several shorter visits over 12 months

You will need to register your vehicle if you want to move it between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland.
