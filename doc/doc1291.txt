The law decides who’ll inherit assets (for example, money or property) if there’s no will. Use the inheritance calculator to work out who’ll inherit.

Before you apply for probate, you need to estimate the value of the estate of the person who died. You’ll need this estimate when you apply.

If you do not want to apply

If you’re the most entitled person but you do not want to administer the estate, you can either appoint someone else to do it or permanently give up your right to administer the estate.
