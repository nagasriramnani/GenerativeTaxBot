How to claim

Business cars

You can claim capital allowances on cars you buy and use in your business. This means you can deduct part of the value from your profits before you pay tax.

Use writing down allowances to work out what you can claim.

There’s a different way to work out what you can claim if the car qualifies for the 100% first year allowance - for example, if it’s an electric car or a car with zero CO2 emissions.

Cars do not qualify for annual investment allowance.
