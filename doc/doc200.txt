You’ll only have to pay Inheritance Tax if both:

you inherited property, money or shares in the UK

the deceased’s estate does not have the money to pay the Inheritance Tax

The normal rules for paying Income Tax apply if you get income from something you’ve inherited, for example rental income from a UK property.

If you’re a non-resident and you inherit UK property or land you have to pay tax on any gains you make when you sell it. You do not pay tax if you inherit and sell other assets, for example UK shares.
