If you run an investment club

The investment club treasurer or secretary should:

divide any income, gains and losses between its members according to the club’s rules

give every member a written statement at the end of each tax year - you can use HMRC’s investment club certificate (PDF, 212KB)

keep records including members’ income and gains

arrange to buy shares from members who want to leave the club

If you’re starting a new investment club, make sure it has a constitution and rules. Get legal advice from a professional if you need help.
