If the person who died was widowed or is giving away their home to their children, the tax threshold can be higher.

Working out your estimate

You need to estimate the total value of the estate. This includes:

the value of the things the person owned (their assets) on the day they died

any gifts they made, such as cash or items of value, in the 7 years before they died

the value of any trusts where the person had a beneficial interest

At this stage, your estimate only needs to be accurate enough for you to know if the estate owes tax. You’ll need accurate valuations if the estate owes any tax.
