Check your Simple Assessment tax bill

You may get a Simple Assessment letter from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you:

owe Income Tax that cannot be automatically taken out of your income

owe HMRC £3,000 or more

have to pay tax on the State Pension

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Understanding your tax bill

Your letter will show:

your taxable income (for example, income from pay, pensions or state benefits)

any Income Tax you’ve paid

the tax you owe

Check the amounts in your letter match those in your records, for example in your P60, bank statements or letters from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

If you get state benefits paid every 4 weeks, work out the total paid in a year by multiplying your regular payment by 13 (not 12).
