Apportionment Scheme

Who can use it

You can only use this scheme if you buy goods for resale.

You can’t use apportionment if you provide:

services

goods that you’ve made or grown yourself

catering services

Your turnover, excluding VAT, can’t be more than £1 million a year.

There is a separate scheme for businesses with a turnover of between £1 and £130 million.

How to calculate your VAT

Calculate the total value of goods purchased for resale in the VAT period for each VAT rate.

Divide the total of purchases for each VAT rate by the total for all purchases.
