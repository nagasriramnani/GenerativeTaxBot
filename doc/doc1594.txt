How to serve a statutory demand

You must deliver (‘serve’) the statutory demand form by:

giving it to the individual who owes you money (you should try all their known addresses)

leaving it at the registered office of the company or partnership that owes money (or the main place of business if they do not have a registered office)

giving it to the company’s director, company secretary, manager or principal officer

get a ‘process server’ to serve it for you (a solicitor can arrange this)
