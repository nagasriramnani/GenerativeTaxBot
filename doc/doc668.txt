Payment due dates

We’ll write to you with a payment schedule telling you how much to pay and all your payment deadlines.

Make sure cleared funds are in HMRC’s bank account by the deadline, or you may get a surcharge.

If the deadline falls on a weekend or bank holiday, your payment must clear HMRC’s bank account on the last working day before it, unless you pay by Faster Payments.

Due dates for payments on account

The due dates for payments on account are the last working day of the second and third months of every VAT quarter no matter what your period end date is. The 7 day extension for paying electronically does not apply to payments on account.
