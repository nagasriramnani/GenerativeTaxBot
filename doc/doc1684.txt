Company Share Option Plan

This gives you the option to buy up to £60,000 worth of shares in the future at a fixed price.

You will not pay Income Tax or National Insurance contributions on the difference between what you pay for the shares and what they’re actually worth.

You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you sell the shares.
