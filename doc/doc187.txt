Write to HMRC

You must write to HMRC if you’ve missed the deadline to make changes or you need to make a change to another tax year.

You’ll also need to write HMRC a letter to:

claim overpayment relief

report income you did not include in your tax return

You can claim a refund up to 4 years after the end of the tax year it relates to.

What to include

You must include:

the tax year you’re correcting

why you think you’ve paid too much or little tax

how much you think you’ve over or underpaid

your signature (no one else can sign on your behalf)

If you’re making a claim, also include in your letter:

that you’re making a claim for overpayment relief

proof that you’d paid tax through Self Assessment for the relevant period

how you want to be repaid
