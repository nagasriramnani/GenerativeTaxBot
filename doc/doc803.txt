Claim repairs as business expenses if you’re a sole trader or partnership - deduct from your profits as a business cost if you’re a limited company.

Integral features

Integral features are:

lifts, escalators and moving walkways

space and water heating systems

air-conditioning and air cooling systems

hot and cold water systems (but not toilet and kitchen facilities)

electrical systems, including lighting systems

external solar shading

Fixtures

You can claim for fixtures, for example:

fitted kitchens

bathroom suites

fire alarm and CCTV systems

You can claim if you rent or own the building, but only the person who bought the item can claim.

When you buy a building from a previous business owner you can only claim for integral features and fixtures that they claimed for.
