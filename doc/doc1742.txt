If you’re stopped by the police

You must show police that you can use the vehicle in the UK without taxing and registering it here, for example proof:

of the time you’ve been in the UK (such as a ferry ticket)

that your vehicle’s eligible for relief from VAT and duty (such as a customs relief form)

When you need Q number plates

You must get temporary Q number plates from DVLA if you visit the UK for up to 6 months and either:

your number plates display numbers or letters that are not identifiable in the UK, for example Arabic script

your vehicle is not registered in its home country

Contact DVLA if you have to get temporary Q number plates.

Before you get Q number plates

You must claim relief from VAT and duty before you can get temporary Q number plates.
