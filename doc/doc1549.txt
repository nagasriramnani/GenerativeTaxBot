Returns for someone who has died

You must complete a Self Assessment tax return for someone who’s died if HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has asked you to and sent you a form.

If you have not already told HMRC about a death you must do this as soon as possible. Use the Tell Us Once service to let HMRC and other government organisations know about the death.

Filling in the return

You’ll usually need details of the deceased’s bank and savings accounts, for example:

bank statements

building society pass books

dividend vouchers
