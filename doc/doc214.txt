What happens at the hearing

Do not go to court if you have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms or if you’re self-isolating or in quarantine. Tell the court if you cannot attend.

If there’s a hearing, you can:

represent yourself

pay for a barrister or solicitor to represent you

ask someone to advise you in court - they do not have to be a lawyer

ask someone to speak on your behalf - you might need to get the court’s permission
