Payments on account arrangements

‘Payments on account’ are advance payments towards your VAT bill.

HMRC will tell you to make payments on account if you send VAT returns quarterly and you owe more than £2.3 million in any period of 12 months or less.

The £2.3 million threshold includes VAT on imports and moving goods into and out of excise warehouses.
