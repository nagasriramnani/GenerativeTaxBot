Rental income

You need to pay tax on your rental income if you rent out a property in the UK.

You may also need to pay tax if you make a gain when you sell property or land in the UK.

If you live abroad for 6 months or more per year, you’re classed as a ‘non-resident landlord’ by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) - even if you’re a UK resident for tax purposes.

How you pay tax

You can get your rent either:

in full and pay tax through Self Assessment - if HMRC allows you to do this

with tax already deducted by your letting agent or tenant
