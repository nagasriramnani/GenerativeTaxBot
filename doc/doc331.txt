If there’s Inheritance Tax to pay

Fill out and send form IHT400 and form IHT421 to HMRC and wait 20 working days before applying for probate.

You normally have to pay at least some of the tax before you’ll get probate. You can claim the tax back from the estate, if you pay it out of your own bank account.

What you’ll need to apply

You’ll need the death certificate or an interim death certificate from the coroner. You’ll also need the original will, if there is one.
