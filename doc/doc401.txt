Errors

If you’ve made an error in your VAT return the VAT account must show:

the date you discovered the error

details about the error - for example how it happened and how you corrected it

You might also need to report the error to HMRC.

Bad debts

If a customer does not pay what they owe for goods or services, you can write off the invoice as a ‘bad debt’. You may be able to claim relief from VAT for bad debts. Do this in your VAT Return.

If you write off an invoice as a bad debt, you must keep a separate ‘VAT bad debt account’. The debt must be older than 6 months when you make your claim.
