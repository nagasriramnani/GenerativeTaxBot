Bare trusts

Assets in a bare trust are held in the name of a trustee. However, the beneficiary has the right to all of the capital and income of the trust at any time if theyâ€™re 18 or over (in England and Wales), or 16 or over (in Scotland). This means the assets set aside by the settlor will always go directly to the intended beneficiary.

Bare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is old enough.

Example

You leave your sister some money in your will. The money is held in trust.

Your sister is entitled to the money and any income (for example interest) it earns. She can also take possession of any of the money at any time.
