Your vehicle needs to be added to the NOVA system before you can register it with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). Email the following to the HMRC CARS team so that HMRC can make your NOVA application:

the C88/E2 customs documents for your vehicle (except if you brought your vehicle into the UK through the Channel Tunnel or by ferry)

the invoice or bill of sale for your vehicle, or a current valuation from a third-party such as a garage or dealership in the UK (it cannot be an online valuation)

any official document which confirms the VIN or chassis number of your vehicle (for example, a registration or title document, or an export certificate)
