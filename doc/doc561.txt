For items such as jewellery, paintings or other household goods, work out how much you would have got if you’d sold them on the open market. You can use online marketplaces to help work out their value.

Valuing joint assets

You need to find out what assets the person owned with someone else and how they were owned.

The rules for valuing joint assets, such as property, jewellery or paintings, are different depending on whether they were owned as:

‘joint tenants’ (known as ‘joint owners’ in Scotland)

‘tenants in common’ (known as ‘common owners’ in Scotland)

Joint tenants

Joint tenants automatically pass on any assets, such as land or property, to the other owners if one of them dies.
