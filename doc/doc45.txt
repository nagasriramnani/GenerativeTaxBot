Pay some of the money

If you do not agree with the amount on the claim form, you can apply to the court to pay only what you think you owe.

You must send the court both:

an admission form to say how much you’ll pay

a defence form to explain why you do not owe the full amount

Respond online if the claim was made using Money Claim Online.

Otherwise, which forms you fill in will depend on whether the claim is for a fixed (‘specified’) or an unspecified amount.
