If the property was sold at less than the market value, relief is limited by the proportion that was given as a gift.

Example

John sells a field on his farm worth £2,000 to his son David on the next-door farm for £500. This means that he is giving David a gift of 75% of the value of the field = £1,500.

David sells the field a year later and uses the £2,000 from the sale to buy another field for £2,000.

John dies 3 years after the sale.

When IHT is calculated the original market value (£2,000) of the field, less the £500 paid (the value that was transferred), rather than the current market value of the field (£2,500) is included as a gift made by John and is eligible for Agricultural Relief.
