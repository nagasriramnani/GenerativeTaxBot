Pay money into the Court Funds Office

You must pay into the Court Funds Office if:

you’ve been ordered to make a payment to settle a court case

you offered to settle in full before the case started - but it was not accepted and you want to use a ‘defence of tender before claim’

you have to refund an overpayment

Check the court ordered you to pay into the Court Funds Office. Sometimes they’ll order you to pay the claimant directly.

Find out about paying into a Court Funds Office account if you’re someone’s deputy or litigation friend.
