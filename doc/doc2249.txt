If you still have tax to pay after you’ve made your payments on account, you must make a ‘balancing payment’ by midnight on 31 January next year.

Example
Your bill for the 2021 to 2022 tax year is £3,000. You made 2 payments of £900 each (£1,800 in total) on account towards this bill in 2021.

The total tax to pay by midnight on 31 January 2023 is £2,700. This includes:

your ‘balancing payment’ of £1,200 for the 2021 to 2022 tax year (£3,000 minus £1,800)

the first payment on account of £1,500 (half your 2021 to 2022 tax bill) towards your 2022 to 2023 tax bill

You then make a second payment on account of £1,500 on 31 July 2023.
