When you need to pay tax

You may need to pay tax on your foreign income in the normal way if you:

are from a country without a double-taxation agreement for students

have other income that you do not bring to the UK

bring it to the UK and spend it on things other than living costs and course fees

plan to stay in the UK as your permanent home (‘domicile’)

If you work in the UK

Some double-taxation agreements mean you do not pay UK tax on your income if you work while you’re a student.

If your country does not have an agreement like this, you have to pay tax in the same way as others who come to live in the UK.
