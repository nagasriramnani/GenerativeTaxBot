If you need to change your return

You can make a change to a tax return after you filed it, for example because you made a mistake.

Your bill will be updated based on what you report. You may have to pay more tax or be able to claim a refund.

Thereâ€™s a different process if you need to report foreign income.

Updating your tax return

You can correct a tax return within 12 months of the Self Assessment deadline, online or by sending another paper return.
