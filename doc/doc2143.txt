rate of VAT

amount of VAT payable

If you decide to issue an invoice at the start of a period, you do not have to account for VAT on any payment until either the date the payment’s due or the date you receive it, whichever happens first.

The same procedures apply to continuous supplies of goods, in the form of water, gas and electricity.

If there’s a VAT rate change during the period covered by an invoice for continuous supplies, you can declare VAT at the new rate on the part of the supply of goods or services you made after the rate change - even though the normal tax point happened earlier. For example, where a payment is received before the goods or services are supplied.
