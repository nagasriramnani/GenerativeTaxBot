Work out your gain

Your gain is usually the difference between what you paid for your personal possession and what you sold it for.

Use the market value instead if:

it was a gift (there are different rules if it was to your spouse, civil partner or a charity)

you sold it for less than it was worth to help the buyer

you inherited it (and donâ€™t know the Inheritance Tax value)

you owned it before April 1982

Deduct costs

You can deduct certain costs of buying, selling or improving your personal possession from your gain.

Costs you can deduct include:

fees, eg for valuing or advertising
