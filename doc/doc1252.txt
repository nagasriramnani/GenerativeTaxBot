How much VAT you must charge

There are 3 different rates of VAT that can be added to products. Which one applies depends on the goods and services, and how they’re used.

Most goods and services are charged at the standard rate of 20%. You should charge this rate unless the goods or services are classed as reduced or zero-rated.

Examples of zero-rated items include:

books and newspapers

children’s clothes and shoes

motorcycle helmets

most goods you export from England, Wales and Scotland (Great Britain) to a country outside the UK
