There’s a different way to report your client’s Capital Gains Tax on UK property as an agent.

If you’re reporting on behalf of a trust

If you’re reporting as a trustee of a registered trust, you’ll need the trust’s registration number or unique tax reference.

If you’re a corporate trustee, you’ll need to use a paper form for the 2022 to 2023 tax year and for the 2023 to 2024 tax year.

For the tax years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 - or if you cannot access the internet - you’ll need to ask HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for a paper form.

If you do not pay when you report

You can pay after you report your gains by:

approving a payment through your online bank account

online or telephone banking

debit or credit card

cheque
