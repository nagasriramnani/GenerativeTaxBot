Ways to pay

You’ll need your 14-digit reference number starting with ‘x’ to pay.

If you sold a property in the UK on or after 6 April 2020, you can find your number:

in your Capital Gains Tax on UK property account if you sent your return online

in a letter sent to you by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you submitted a return on paper or on behalf of someone else

If you used the ‘real time’ Capital Gains Tax Service, you can find your number in a letter or email sent by HMRC.
