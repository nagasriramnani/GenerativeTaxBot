If you’ve been charged a penalty for not sending a tax return but you do not need to send one, you can get your penalty cancelled. Tell HMRC online you do not need to be self assessed or call the helpline.

Otherwise, to appeal you’ll need:

the date the penalty was issued

the date you filed your Self Assessment tax return

details of your reasonable excuse for late filing

If you’re appealing against a £100 late filing penalty from tax year 2015 to 2016 onwards, you can appeal online or by post. You’ll need to set up a Government Gateway account if you do not have one to appeal online.

For other Self Assessment penalties, you need to appeal by post. Send a completed form SA370 or a letter explaining your appeal to HMRC Self Assessment.
