If youâ€™re late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs.

Ask to change the payments

You can ask to change the terms of the judgment - for example, how and when you pay.

To do this, fill in the N245 application form.

Give details of your income and spending, and say how much you can realistically afford to pay.

You may have to pay a court fee.

If your offer is rejected, the court will decide on the amount you have to pay.

If you do not pay what the court has ordered

If you do not pay as ordered, the person or business you owe money to may:

threaten you with bailiffs to collect the money

ask the court to take action against you to force you to pay
