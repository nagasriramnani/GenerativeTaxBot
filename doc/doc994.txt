Find a lost National Insurance number

If you do not know your National Insurance number, the quickest and easiest way to find it is:

online through your personal tax account

in the HMRC app

on a document you already have, for example a payslip or P60

If you need a letter that shows your National Insurance number, you can print one from your personal tax account or the app.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will not tell you your National Insurance number over the phone. If you call them, it can take up to 15 days to get a letter with your National Insurance number.
