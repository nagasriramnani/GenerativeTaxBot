Work out the available Inheritance Tax threshold. Take the basic threshold of £325,000, including any unused basic threshold from a late spouse or civil partner’s estate, and deduct the value of any gifts made within 7 years of the death from it. If the value of the gifts is more than the basic threshold, there’ll be Inheritance Tax to pay on those gifts. Add any residence nil rate band (RNRB), including anything transferred from a late spouse or civil partner, to get to the available threshold.

Compare the value of the estate at the end of step 4 (the value of the estate that you’ll pay tax on known as the ‘chargeable estate’) with the available threshold at the end of step 5.
