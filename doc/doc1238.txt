Overview

You have to present a bankruptcy petition to a court if you want to bankrupt someone because they owe you money.

There are also other ways to recover money you’re owed.

A bankruptcy petition is an application to the court for someone’s assets to be taken and sold to pay their debts.

Presenting a petition can be complicated. Most people use a solicitor or other professional to help them.

Using a mediation service could be quicker and cheaper. Mediation is when an impartial person helps 2 sides work out an agreement.

You can contact the Insolvency Service if you have questions about making someone bankrupt.
