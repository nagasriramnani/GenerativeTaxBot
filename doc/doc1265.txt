you’ve joined a margin or capital goods VAT scheme

You cannot use the scheme with the Cash Accounting Scheme. Instead, the Flat Rate Scheme has its own cash-based method for calculating the turnover.

Leaving the scheme

You must leave the scheme if:

you’re no longer eligible to be in it

on the anniversary of joining, your turnover in the last 12 months was more than £230,000 (including VAT) - or you expect it to be in the next 12 months

you expect your total income in the next 30 days alone to be more than £230,000 (including VAT)
