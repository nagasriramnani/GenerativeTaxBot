You’ll get separate penalties for submitting your return late and paying late.

If you submit your return late

For each VAT Return you send late, you’ll get a penalty point. This includes nil returns (where you have nothing to declare).

You’ll get a further £200 penalty for each subsequent late submission while you’re at the threshold.
