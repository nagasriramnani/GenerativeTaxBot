To make sure you meet the 60-day filing requirement for a Capital Gains Tax UK property return, you may submit an estimated return if you are waiting on a CG34 valuation. When you have the actual valuation figure you can then amend your return.

If we agree your valuations we’ll not question your use of those valuations in your return.

If we do not agree with your valuation we will suggest a different valuation to negotiate with you.

Email HMRC to ask for this form in Welsh (Cymraeg).
