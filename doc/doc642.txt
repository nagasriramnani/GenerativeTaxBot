Building new homes

You may not have to charge VAT on labour or building materials for work you do on a new house or flat.

What counts as new

For work to be zero-rated for VAT, it must qualify as a genuinely new, self-contained house or flat. This means:

itâ€™s self-contained - there are not any internal doors or connections to other houses or flats

it can be used independently of any other property, including businesses

it can be sold on its own

it has proper planning permission
