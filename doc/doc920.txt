Understanding your bill

Your bill includes the tax you owe for the last tax year. This is called a ‘balancing payment’ on your bill.

If this is more than £1,000, your bill will usually include an additional payment towards next year’s bill (known as a ‘payment on account’).

If you made payments on account last year

You’ll need to deduct any payments on account you made last year towards this year’s bill to work out what you owe.

Paying your bill

You need to pay your Self Assessment tax bill by midnight on 31 January (following the tax year you’re paying for) to avoid a penalty.
