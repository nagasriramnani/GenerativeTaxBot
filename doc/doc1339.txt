Reporting changes to HMRC

You can lose Enhanced protection or any type of Fixed protection if you do not meet certain conditions.

The conditions for losing your lifetime allowance protection depend on when HMRC received your application.

Tell HMRC in writing if you think you might have lost your protection.

If you have the right to take your pension before 50

You may have a reduced lifetime allowance if you have the right to take your pension before you’re 50 under a pension scheme you joined before 2006.

This only applies to people in certain jobs (for example professional sports, dance and modelling) who start taking their pension before they’re 55.
