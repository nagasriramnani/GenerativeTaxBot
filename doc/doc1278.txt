Any interest you get from HMRC counts as taxable income.

Paying interest to your customers

You must pay any of the interest you get (as well as the VAT) to your customers if HMRCâ€™s mistake means they paid too much VAT.

Contact the person at HMRC who dealt with your claim if you need to find out how the interest was calculated. This can help you work out how much you need to repay each customer.

You must give the money back to HMRC within 14 days if you cannot get in touch with a customer to repay them.

Challenging an HMRC decision

You cannot appeal the decision to charge you interest but you can challenge the amount of interest charged.
