Read the information on the different types of trust to understand the main differences between them. If you’re not sure what type of trust you have, ask the trustees.

If you’re the beneficiary of a bare trust you are responsible for declaring and paying tax on its income. Do this on a Self Assessment tax return.

If you do not usually send a tax return and need to, you must register for Self Assessment by 5 October following the tax year you had the income.

Interest in possession trusts

If you’re the beneficiary of this type of trust, you’re entitled to its income (after expenses) as it arises.

If you ask for a statement, the trustees must tell you:

the different sources of income

how much income you’ve been given

how much tax has been paid on the income
