The tax point will be either the date you issue a VAT invoice for the advance payment, or the date you receive the advance payment, whichever happens first.

You include the VAT due on the advance payment on your VAT Return for the period when the tax point occurs.

If the customer pays you the remaining balance before the goods are delivered or the services are performed, a further tax point is created. This will be either when you issue a VAT invoice for the balance, or when you receive payment of the balance, whichever happens first.

You then include the VAT due on the balance on the return for when the further tax point occurs.
