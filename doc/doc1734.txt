Include the name, number and sort code of the bank account you want the refund to go to.

The letter must be signed by the same people who signed forms IHT400 and IHT100 if:

you’re applying without the help of a solicitor or agent

the refund is being paid into a different bank account to the one nominated in IHT400 or IHT100

If you’re an agent acting on behalf of the estate and you’re not asking for the refund to be paid into a different bank account, only put your signature on the letter.
