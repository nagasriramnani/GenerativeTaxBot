Business assets of £50,000 and more

There are special rules for reclaiming VAT in the Capital Goods Scheme, which means you must spread the initial VAT claimed over a number of years.

What you cannot reclaim

You cannot reclaim VAT for:

anything that’s only for personal use

goods and services your business uses to make VAT-exempt supplies

the cost of entertaining or providing hospitality to people you do business with (for example theatre or sports tickets)

goods sold to you under one of the VAT second-hand margin schemes

business assets that are transferred to you as a ‘going concern’
