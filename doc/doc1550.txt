If the deceased was employed or receiving a pension you’ll usually need:

work or pension payslips

details of any expenses paid by the employer

confirmation of any state pension

You’ll also need details of any other income they had, for example if they rented out property or ran their own business.

Contact HMRC’s Bereavement helpline if you need help completing a return for someone who has died or if you cannot find their records.

Sending the return

Send the completed Self Assessment form by post.

The return must reach HMRC by the date given in the letter you received with the form.

You can hire a professional (such as an accountant) to help you submit a tax return on behalf of the deceased.
