Free shares

Your employer can give you up to £3,600 of free shares in any tax year.

Partnership shares

You can buy shares out of your salary before tax deductions. There’s a limit to how much you can spend - either £1,800 or 10% of your income for the tax year, whichever is lower.

Matching shares

Your employer can give you up to 2 free matching shares for each partnership share you buy.

Dividend shares

You may be able to buy more shares with the dividends you get from free, partnership or matching shares (but only if your employer’s scheme allows it).

You will not pay Income Tax if you keep the dividend shares for at least 3 years.

You’ll have to pay Income Tax and National Insurance on any shares you take out of a SIP early.
