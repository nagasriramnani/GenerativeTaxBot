You might be able to leave out these payments from your VAT calculations because it’s the customer, not you, who buys and receives the goods or services; you’re just acting as their agent.

To treat a payment as a disbursement all of the following must apply:

you paid the supplier on your customer’s behalf and acted as the agent of your customer

your customer received, used or had the benefit of the goods or services you paid for on their behalf

it was your customer’s responsibility to pay for the goods or services, not yours

you had permission from your customer to make the payment

your customer knew that the goods or services were from another supplier, not from you
