Direct Debit

Use your VAT online account to set up a Direct Debit.

Set up the Direct Debit at least 3 working days before you submit your online VAT return, otherwise the payment will not be taken from your bank account in time.

Once youâ€™ve set up the Direct Debit, payments will be collected automatically from your bank account 3 working days after the payment deadline on your VAT return.

If you file your VAT return late, your payment will be taken 3 days after you file the return.
