Current rates and allowances

How much Income Tax you pay in each tax year depends on:

how much of your income is above your Personal Allowance

how much of your income falls within each tax band

Some income is tax-free.

The current tax year is from 6 April 2023 to 5 April 2024.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Your tax-free Personal Allowance

The standard Personal Allowance is £12,570, which is the amount of income you do not have to pay tax on.

Your Personal Allowance may be bigger if you claim Marriage Allowance or Blind Person’s Allowance. It’s smaller if your income is over £100,000.
