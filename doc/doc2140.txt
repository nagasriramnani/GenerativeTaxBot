If the customer pays you the remaining balance before the goods are delivered or the services are performed, a further tax point is created. This will be either when you issue a VAT invoice for the balance, or when you receive payment of the balance, whichever happens first.

You then include the VAT due on the balance on the return for when the further tax point occurs.

Returnable deposits

You may ask your customers to pay a deposit when they hire goods from you. You do not have to account for VAT if the deposit is either:

refunded in full to the customer when they return the goods safely

kept by you to compensate you for loss or damage
