qualify for some benefits

You may be able to pay voluntary contributions to fill any gaps if you’re eligible.

Check your record for gaps

Check your National Insurance record to find out:

if you have any gaps

if you’re eligible to pay voluntary contributions

how much it will cost

You may also be eligible for National Insurance credits if you claim benefits because you cannot work, are unemployed or caring for someone full time.

Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you think your National Insurance record is wrong.

Decide if you want to pay voluntary contributions

Voluntary contributions do not always increase your State Pension.
