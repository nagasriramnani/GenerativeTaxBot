Tell HMRC you’ve changed your address.

Tell HMRC your name has changed. You’ll need a Government Gateway user ID and password. If you do not have a user ID you can create one when you update your name.

Your name will be updated automatically if you change gender.

There are different ways to tell HMRC if you:

only pay tax through Self Assessment

are a tax agent, for example an accountant

Tax agents can also update these details by phone or in writing.
