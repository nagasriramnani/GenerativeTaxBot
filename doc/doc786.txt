Tax compliance checks

Your tax affairs may be checked to make sure you’re paying the right amount. This can happen if you’re an individual taxpayer or if you run a business.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

What HMRC can check

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will write or phone to say what they want to check. This could be:

any taxes you pay

accounts and tax calculations

your Self Assessment tax return

your Company Tax Return

PAYE records and returns, if you employ people

If you use an accountant, HMRC will contact them instead.

To authorise someone other than a tax agent, write to HMRC. Tell them who you want to use and for which tax.
