If you do not have an HMRC payslip

Include a note with:

your name, address and telephone number

the 18-digit reference number shown on your payment request, or your National Insurance number

how much youâ€™re paying

If you do not have an 18-digit reference number you can get help from the National Insurance Helpline.

Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.
