request a judgment if you made your claim online

use request for judgment form N225 if you claimed a fixed (‘specified’) amount using a claim form

use request for judgment form N227 if you claimed an unspecified amount using a claim form

If you disagree with the response

You might have to go to a court hearing if:

the defendant says they do not owe you any money

they disagree with the amount you’ve claimed

you do not agree with how they’ve offered to repay you

The court may send you a questionnaire asking for more information on the case.

Fill in the questionnaire and return it to the court. You’ll have to pay an extra court fee.

Mediation

You may be offered mediation after you’ve made a claim. This is often quicker than going to court.
