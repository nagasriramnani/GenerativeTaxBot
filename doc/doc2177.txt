If you do not know the claim amount

Use the paper claim form if you do not know the exact amount - you cannot make a claim online.

You’ll need to estimate the amount you’re claiming and pay the fee for that amount.

For example, if you estimate you’re claiming between £3,000.01 and £5,000, you’d have to pay £205.

If you leave the ‘amount claimed’ blank, the fee is £10,000.
