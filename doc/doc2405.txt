Check a UK VAT number

Use this service to check:

if a UK VAT registration number is valid

the name and address of the business the number is registered to

This service is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

If you are a UK VAT-registered business, you can also use this service to prove when you checked a UK VAT number. You will need your own VAT number to do this.

You cannot use this service if you’ve already applied to register for VAT and you’re waiting to hear back from HMRC. Check when you should expect a reply.
