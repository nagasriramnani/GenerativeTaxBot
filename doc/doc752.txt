Debts that will not be written off

When you’re discharged you’ll be released from most, but not all, of the debts you owed at the date of the bankruptcy.

Debts you will not be released from include:

debts arising from fraud

anything you owe under family proceedings - unless the court decides otherwise

damages for personal injuries to anyone - unless the court decides otherwise

debts which were not included in the bankruptcy itself, for example a debt to the Student Loans Company
