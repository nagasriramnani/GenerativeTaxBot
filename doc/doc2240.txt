Travel and overnight expenses

If you have to travel for your work you may be able to claim tax relief on the cost or money you’ve spent on food or overnight expenses.

You cannot claim for travelling to and from work, unless you’re travelling to a temporary place of work.

You can claim tax relief for money you’ve spent on things like:

public transport costs

hotel accommodation if you have to stay overnight

food and drink

congestion charges and tolls

parking fees

business phone calls and printing costs
