Vehicles

Calculate your vehicle expenses using a flat rate for mileage instead of the actual costs of buying and running your vehicle, for example insurance, repairs, servicing, fuel.

You can use simplified expenses for:

cars (except those designed for commercial use, for example, black cabs, hackney carriages or dual control driving instructors’ cars)

goods vehicles (for example, vans)

motorcycles

You cannot claim simplified expenses for a vehicle you’ve already claimed capital allowances for, or you’ve included as an expense when you worked out your business profits.
