Get a decision set aside

You can ask for a decision to be ‘set aside’ (cancelled), but only if you think there was a mistake in the process. The letter you get with the decision will tell you how to do this.
Contact Citizens Advice if you need help.

Ask for permission to appeal

You may be able to appeal against the decision if the tribunal made a legal mistake, for example if it did not:

apply the law correctly

fully explain its decision

Ask for full written reasons if you’ve not had them already. You must do this within 28 days of the date on the decision notice - the decision notice will tell you how.

Ask for permission to appeal - download the appeal form and read the guidance notes. You must do this within 56 days of the date given on the full written reasons.
