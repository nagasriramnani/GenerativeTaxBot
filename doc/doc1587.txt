If you then move the goods to Northern Ireland you will be charged VAT of £2,000. The partial exemption calculation at that time only permits £900 to be recovered.

This would mean you have paid £4,000 VAT and only claimed £1,900 as input tax.

To remedy this, you should treat the movement as if it were a fully taxable supply. This will allow you to recover the originally restricted input tax as being fully attributable to that taxable supply.

You can do this as part of your annual adjustment. The VAT may be reclaimed subject to the normal rules.
