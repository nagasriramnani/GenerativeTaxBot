If you drive a hybrid

If your company car has CO2 emissions of 1 to 50g/km, the value of the car is based on its zero emission mileage figure, or ‘electric range’. This is the distance the car can go on electric power before its batteries need recharging.

Contact your employer to find out your car’s zero emission mileage figure.

Check or update your company car tax

Tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if your car or fuel details change. You can check or update your company car tax online, for example if:

you get a company car or give one back

your employer starts or stops paying for fuel for you to use personally

If a change affects the value of the car, HMRC will update your tax code so you pay the right tax.
