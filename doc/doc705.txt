Discretionary trusts are sometimes set up to put assets aside for:

a future need, like a grandchild who may need more financial help than other beneficiaries at some point in their life

beneficiaries who are not capable or responsible enough to deal with money themselves

Accumulation trusts

This is where the trustees can accumulate income within the trust and add it to the trustâ€™s capital. They may also be able to pay income out, as with discretionary trusts.

Mixed trusts

These are a combination of more than one type of trust. The different parts of the trust are treated according to the tax rules that apply to each part.
