The scheme would not suit your business if you regularly reclaim VAT because you’ll only be able to get 1 refund a year (when you submit the VAT Return).

You can join the scheme if your estimated VAT taxable turnover is £1.35 million or less.

Talk to an accountant or tax adviser if you want advice on whether the Annual Accounting Scheme is right for you.
