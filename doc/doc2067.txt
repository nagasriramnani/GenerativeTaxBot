Sometimes it will not be possible to agree values before your tax return has to be filed. You must still file your tax return and enter the amount of gain or loss that you expect us to agree a valuation on.

How to disagree with a valuation

We settle almost all of valuations that are referred to us by negotiation. If you cannot reach an agreement the valuation can be heard by the tax tribunal after you have filed your tax return.

If you think we have made a mistake or treated you unfairly, you can ask for the matter to be reviewed by the Assistant Director in charge of the part of SAV where the valuation was carried out.
