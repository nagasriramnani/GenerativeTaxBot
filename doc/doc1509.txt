Your main home may be where you spend less time, if that’s where:

most of your possessions are

your family lives, if you’re married or in a civil partnership

you’re registered for things like your bank account, GP or car insurance

you’re a member of clubs or societies

This might apply to you if you live away because of your work, for example you’re a lorry driver, an offshore worker or in the armed forces.

How you pay

You’ll pay tax at the Welsh rates through PAYE if you’re employed, or have it deducted by your provider if you’re getting a pension. HMRC will add a ‘C’ to the start of your tax code so that you pay the right rates.

If you fill in a Self Assessment tax return online for the 2022 to 2023 tax year, there’ll be a box for you to tell HMRC you pay the Welsh rates.
