Air Passenger Duty

Airlines pay Air Passenger Duty (APD) for every passenger who flies from the UK. Ticket prices usually include a charge to cover this cost.

You do not pay VAT on the cost of flights.

The amount of APD the airline pays depends on how far away your destination is and the class you travel in.

On commercial passenger flights the duty costs from £6.50 to £200 per flight. There are higher charges for some private passenger planes or charters.
