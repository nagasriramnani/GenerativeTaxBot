You’ll need to include a cheque for £14 - make it payable to ‘HMCTS’. 
If you want to pay by card, contact the court that’s handling your case.

If you cannot get proof of payment

If you cannot get proof from the person or business you owed money to, you can still apply for a certificate of cancellation or satisfaction using form N443.

You’ll need to send evidence to the court showing you made the payment, for example a bank statement. If you do not have evidence, explain this on the form.

The court will write to the person or business you owed money to. If they do not respond within 30 days, the court will use your evidence to make a decision.
