How to record income and expenses

You must keep records of all business income and expenses to work out your profit for your tax return.

Income

With cash basis, only record income you actually received in a tax year. Do not count any money youâ€™re owed but have not yet received.

Example
You invoiced someone on 15 March 2017 but did not receive the money until 30 April 2017. Do not record this income for your 2016 to 2017 tax return, but instead for 2017 to 2018.
