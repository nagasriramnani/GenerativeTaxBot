You will not usually get National Insurance credits unless:

you’re a widow

you get Child Benefit for a child under 12

you’re looking after someone who’s sick or disabled

You may still be able to claim:

benefits based on your husband’s contributions (such as Bereavement Allowance)

statutory payments (such as Statutory Sick Pay)

benefits that are not based on your contributions (such as Carer’s Allowance)

Increase your State Pension

Get a State Pension statement if you want an estimate of what you’ll get when you reach State Pension age. You can also check your National Insurance record for gaps.

You might be able to increase your State Pension.

Stop paying the reduced rate

Once you give up your right to pay the reduced rate, you cannot claim it again.
