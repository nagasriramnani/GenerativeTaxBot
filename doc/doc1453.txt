How long your payment plan lasts

There’s no time limit on how long a payment plan can last. It will depend on how much you owe and what you can afford to pay each month.

You should contact HMRC if anything changes that could affect your payment plan. You can make the payment plan longer or shorter.

If HMRC finds out that your circumstances have changed, they may contact you to discuss changing your repayments.

If you miss a payment

HMRC will contact you to find out why. Where possible, they’ll try to rearrange or renegotiate the payment plan with you.

If you cannot pay another tax bill, contact HMRC. You may be able to include the new tax bill in your Time to Pay arrangement.
