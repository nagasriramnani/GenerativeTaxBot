Payslips: employee rights

Your employer must provide you with a payslip.

They do not have to do this if you’re:

not an employee or ‘worker’, for example a contractor or freelancer

in the police service

a merchant seaman

a master or crew member working in share fishing (paid by a share in the profits or gross earnings of a fishing vessel)

Your payslips can be used as proof of your earnings, tax paid and any pension contributions.

Employers can choose whether they provide printed or electronic (online) payslips.

Payslips must be provided on or before payday.

What should be on your payslip

Your payslip must show:

your earnings before and after any deductions

the amount of any deductions that may change each time you’re paid, for example tax and National Insurance
