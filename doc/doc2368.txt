What records you need to keep for VAT

If you pass on any disbursements to your customers and don’t charge VAT on them, you must keep evidence, such as order forms and invoices, to show that you were entitled to leave the items out of the VAT calculation when you invoiced your customers.

You must also be able to show that you haven’t claimed back the VAT on items you paid for on your customers’ behalf.

Recharges

To claim back the VAT on costs and expenses you pass on to your customers as recharges, you’ll need a valid VAT invoice or receipt for each.
