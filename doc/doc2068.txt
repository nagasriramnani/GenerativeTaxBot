What to expect from SAV

If you appoint an accountant or professional valuation firm we will deal directly with them. Make sure your professional adviser has all the facts, as youâ€™ll be responsible for the accuracy of the information given to SAV.

When we have all the information we need we will try to reach an agreed valuation within 4 weeks of getting your request. If we have to ask you for more information it can take longer.

You can expect us to explain any actions we take. This includes why we:

would like to meet with you

need to question any explanation you have given

propose a valuation different to yours

If you or your professional adviser:

wants to meet to discuss the valuation we will try to arrange a meeting - this may mean the process will take longer than usual
