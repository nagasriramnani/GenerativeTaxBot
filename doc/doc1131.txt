When you’ll start getting payments

After the Child Benefit Office gets your request, it can take up to 21 days before you get your first payment.

The office will write to tell you how much money you’ll get from backdated payments (if any).

Responsibilities after your Child Benefit restarts

You or your partner will have to pay any tax charge on the benefit received from the restart date if your ‘adjusted net income’ is over £50,000.

Use the Child Benefit tax calculator to get an estimate of your adjusted net income and see if you may be affected by the tax charge.

You must report any changes to your family life that affect your Child Benefit.
