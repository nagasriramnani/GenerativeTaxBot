What you’ll need

You’ll need to use your 11-character payment reference when you pay. This is your 10-digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) followed by the letter ‘K’.

You can find it either:

in your HMRC online account

on your paying-in slip, if you get paper statements

Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.

How long it takes

Payments by Faster Payments (online or telephone banking) usually reach HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on the same or next day, including weekends and bank holidays.

CHAPS payments usually reach HMRC the same working day if you pay within your bank’s processing times.
