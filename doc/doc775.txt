If you do not have the original foreign registration certificate, DVLA might accept other proof of the manufacture date, for example a letter from the manufacturer or a vehicle enthusiast club.

Do not send photocopies or faxed copies.

How long it takes

It can take up to 6 weeks for your registration certificate (V5C) to arrive.

You need the V5C to get number plates made up.
