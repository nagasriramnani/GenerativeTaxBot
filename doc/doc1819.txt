How it works

Marriage Allowance lets you transfer £1,260 of your Personal Allowance to your husband, wife or civil partner.

This reduces their tax by up to £252 in the tax year (6 April to 5 April the next year).

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

To benefit as a couple, you (as the lower earner) must normally have an income below your Personal Allowance - this is usually £12,570.

You can calculate how much tax you could save as a couple. You should call the Income Tax helpline instead if you receive other income such as dividends, savings or benefits from your job. You can also call if you do not know what your taxable income is.
