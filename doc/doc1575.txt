What qualifies for VAT relief

Charities pay VAT on all standard-rated goods and services they buy from VAT-registered businesses. They pay VAT at a reduced rate (5%) or the ‘zero rate’ on some goods and services.

What qualifies for the reduced rate

Your charity pays 5% VAT on fuel and power if they’re for:

residential accommodation (for example, a children’s home or care home for the elderly)

charitable non-business activities (for example, free daycare for disabled people)

small-scale use (up to 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month or a delivery of 2,300 litres of gas oil)
