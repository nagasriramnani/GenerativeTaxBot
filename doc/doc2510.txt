In other cases the benefit of a relief on an estate may be lost because other exemptions apply. For example, if a farm is left to a charity the benefit of agricultural relief will be lost because the charity is exempt from Inheritance Tax.

In such cases, HMRC might need to apply the rules of interaction to give a fairer Inheritance Tax bill.

The interaction rules

Apply interaction rules if the estate qualifies for Agricultural or Business Relief and the will also has:

at least one specific gift of property

property subject to tax relief thatâ€™s not specifically given as a gift

some of the estate is exempt from inheritance tax
