Tax when transferring assets

You do not usually have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you give, or otherwise ‘dispose of’, assets to your husband, wife or civil partner before you finalise the divorce or civil partnership.

Assets include shares, certain personal possessions and property. You usually do not have to pay tax if you transfer or sell your main home.

If you transfer an asset when you’re separated

If you lived together at any point in the tax year that you transferred the asset, the normal rules for spouses and civil partners apply.
