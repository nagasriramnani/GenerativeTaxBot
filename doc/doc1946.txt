Overview

From 6 April 2020 you need to report and pay your non-resident Capital Gains Tax using the Capital Gains Tax on UK property account if you’ve sold or disposed of:

residential UK property or land (land for these purposes also includes any buildings on the land)

non-residential UK property or land

mixed use UK property or land

rights to assets that derive at least 75% of their value from UK land (indirect disposals)

A ‘mixed use’ property is one that has both residential and non-residential elements. For example, a flat connected to a shop, doctor’s surgery or office.
