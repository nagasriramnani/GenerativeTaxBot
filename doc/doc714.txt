Donations through Gift Aid

Charities and community amateur sports clubs (CASCs) can register with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to be part of the Gift Aid scheme. When they’re registered, they can claim back the tax you’ve already paid on your donation.

The charity or CASC will give you a form to sign. They must also have an HMRC charity reference number - ask the charity or CASC if you’re not sure.
