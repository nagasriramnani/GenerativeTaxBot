Passing on a home

You can pass a home to your husband, wife or civil partner when you die. There’s no Inheritance Tax to pay if you do this.

If you leave the home to another person in your will, it counts towards the value of the estate.

If you own your home (or a share in it) your tax-free threshold can increase to £500,000 if:

you leave it to your children (including adopted, foster or stepchildren) or grandchildren

your estate is worth less than £2 million

Giving away a home before you die

There’s normally no Inheritance Tax to pay if you move out and live for another 7 years.
