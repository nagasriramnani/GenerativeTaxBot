National Insurance on company benefits

You do not usually have to pay National Insurance on benefits you get from your job.

Your employer will pay National Insurance contributions on them instead.

But you do have to pay National Insurance on things that are paid in cash, as theyâ€™re treated as earnings.

For example, if your employer gives you a gift that you could sell instead of keep, you will pay National Insurance on the value of the gift.
