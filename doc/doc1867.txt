Investment clubs

You work out your gain differently if you’ve bought and sold shares through an investment club.

An investment club is a group of people that buys and sells shares together on the stock market.

Work out your gain

You’ll get a written statement of your gains and losses (an ‘investment club certificate (PDF, 212KB)’) at the end of each tax year from the person who runs the club, for example its treasurer.

When you know your gain, work out if you need to report and pay Capital Gains Tax. There are special rules if you make any losses.
