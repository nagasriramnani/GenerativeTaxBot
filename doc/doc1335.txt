If you took your pension on or after 6 April 2023, there is no lifetime allowance charge. This applies if you took it as a lump sum or any other way, for example pension payments or cash withdrawals. Instead you’ll pay Income Tax on some or all of the lump sum. Your pension provider will take off the charge before you get your payment.

You might be able to protect your pension pot from reductions to the lifetime allowance.

Check how much lifetime allowance you’ve used

Ask your pension provider how much of your lifetime allowance you’ve used.

If you’re in more than one pension scheme, you must add up what you’ve used in all pension schemes you belong to.

What counts towards your allowance depends on the type of pension pot you get.
