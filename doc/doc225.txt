The official receiver will tell you if they should be extended. To extend them, you’ll be asked to agree to a ‘Debt Relief Restrictions Undertaking’. The court can issue a ‘Debt Relief Restrictions Order’ if you do not agree.

What you need to know

While you have a DRO you still have to pay:

your rent and bills

certain debts, for example student loans, court fines

DROs can be cancelled if:

your finances improve

you do not co-operate with the official receiver - for example you do not give them the information they ask for

If you get new debt after your DRO is approved you could:

get a bankruptcy order

be prosecuted if you do not tell new creditors about your DRO

Your DRO is added to the Individual Insolvency Register - it’s removed 3 months after the DRO ends.
