Get an estimate of how much you’ll need to pay in penalties and interest if you’ve missed the deadline for:

sending your Self Assessment tax return

paying your Self Assessment tax bill

This calculator can only give an estimate of what you owe and does not take account of:

payments you’ve made towards your tax bill

outstanding interest or penalties for previous tax years

credit you have from previous tax years

Do not use the calculator if you:

got your request to fill in a Self Assessment less than 3 months before the deadline, so had more time to file it

sent a paper return after 31 October, but HMRC agreed you had a reasonable excuse to not file online
