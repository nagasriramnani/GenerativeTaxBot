Tips and tax

You have to pay Income Tax on any tips you get, and may have to pay National Insurance.

Who reports the tax and whether you pay National Insurance depends on:

how the customer paid the tip

how tips are managed at your workplace

Tips paid directly to you

If you keep the tips you get directly from customers you must report them to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) yourself.

You must report tips in one of the following ways:

in a Self Assessment tax return if you already fill one in

through your personal tax account online

by calling HMRC

HMRC will change your tax code if needed. Your employer will then deduct any tax you owe on tips when you get paid. You will not need to pay National Insurance.
