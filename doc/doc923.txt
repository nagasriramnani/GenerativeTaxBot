Get an administration order

Fill in an application for an administration order (form N92) and return it to your local court.

The court decides:

how much of your debt you have to repay, for example all or just part of it

how much your monthly repayments will be

how long the arrangement lasts

The arrangement is known as a ‘composition order’ if you cannot pay all your debts.

Costs

There’s a court fee each time you make a payment. This cannot be more than 10% of your debt.

Example

If you owe £5,000 the total fee cannot be more than £500.

Eligibility

You must:

owe less than £5,000, including any interest and charges

owe money to at least 2 creditors

prove you can afford regular repayments, for example by giving details of your income
