Companies and trusts

A company is a ‘non-resident landlord’ if it receives income from renting UK property and either:

its main office or business premises is outside the UK

it’s incorporated outside the UK

Your company will get its rent in full if it’s resident in the UK for tax purposes - this includes UK branches of companies based abroad if they’re registered for Corporation Tax.
