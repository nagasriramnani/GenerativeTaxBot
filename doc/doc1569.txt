Joint property, shares and bank accounts

You do not usually have to pay any Stamp Duty or tax when you inherit property, shares or the money in joint bank accounts you owned with the deceased.

Inheritance Tax

What you pay will depend on how you owned the shares or property or how your bank accounts were set up.

If you and the deceased jointly owned the assets, you’ll be known as ‘joint tenants’ (‘joint owners’ in Scotland).
