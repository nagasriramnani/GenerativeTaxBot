If you’re a trustee of a non-UK resident trust, you must report the disposal of UK property or land, even if you have no tax to pay. If you have no tax to pay, you must use a Capital Gains Tax on UK property paper form to report the disposal.

If you need to amend your Capital Gains Tax return

You can amend details of a disposal by using your Capital Gains Tax on UK property account.

Penalties

You have 60 days from the date of conveyance to report your disposal and pay any tax due. You’ll get a late filing penalty and be charged interest if you do not do this by the 60-day deadline.

If you miss the deadline by:

up to 6 months, you will get a penalty of £100

more than 6 months, you’ll get a further penalty of £300 or 5% of any tax due, whichever is greater
