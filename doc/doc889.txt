Overview

You can apply for a VAT refund on building materials and services if you’re:

building a new home

converting a property into a home

building a non-profit communal residence, for example a hospice

building a property for a charity

This is known as the ‘DIY housebuilders’ scheme’. You can only make one claim for a VAT refund under the scheme.

The building work and materials have to qualify and you must apply to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) within 3 months of completing the work.

There is a separate guide to VAT if you’re working in the construction industry.
