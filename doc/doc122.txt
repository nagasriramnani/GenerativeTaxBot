You’ll need to give full and comprehensive information that shows that the shares or securities have become of negligible value.

Negligible value agreements and claims for previously quoted companies

HMRC publishes a list of shares and securities in companies that were previously quoted on the London Stock Exchange and that have been accepted as being of negligible value.

You can use it to find shares which have been declared as being worth negligible value up to and including 31 March 2023.

You’ll still have to submit your claim to HMRC if you own shares or securities for a company shown on the list.

A list is not published for:

unquoted companies

companies formerly quoted on the Alternative Investment Market and PLUS Market

non-UK companies
