If the shares were given or sold to you by someone who claimed Gift Hold-Over Relief, use the amount that person paid for them to work out your gain. If you paid less than they were worth, use the amount you paid for them.

Selling in special circumstances

There are special rules for working out the cost of your shares if you sell:

shares you bought at different times and prices in one company

shares through an investment club

shares after a company merger or takeover

employee share scheme shares

Jointly owned shares and investments

If you sell shares or investments that you own jointly with other people, work out the gain for the portion that you own, instead of the whole value. There are different rules for investment clubs.
