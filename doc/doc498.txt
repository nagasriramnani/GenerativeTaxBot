Importing a vehicle from the Isle of Man

If the vehicle is registered in the Isle of Man, you need to send a completed form V55 and the Isle of Man registration document for the vehicle to the DVLA. You do not need to make an import declaration or NOVA application.

If the vehicle is not registered in the Isle of Man, or if it still has UK licence plates, ask the Imports and exports helpline for form NOVA1. Send this form and a covering letter explaining the situation to the Personal Transport Unit.

If you import a vehicle to Northern Ireland from the EU

Tell HMRC by using the Notification of Vehicle Arrivals (NOVA) service.

You can use a spreadsheet if youâ€™re a VAT-registered business and you need to use NOVA for lots of vehicles.
