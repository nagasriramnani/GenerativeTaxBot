If you want to continue living in your property after giving it away, you’ll need to:

pay rent to the new owner at the going rate (for similar local rental properties)

pay your share of the bills

live there for at least 7 years

Otherwise it counts as a ‘gift with reservation’ and will be added to the value of your estate when you die. (A gift with reservation is where you give something away but continue to benefit from it.)

You do not have to pay rent to the new owners if both the following apply:

you only give away part of your property

the new owners also live at the property

If you die within 7 years

If you die within 7 years of giving away all or part of your property, your home will be treated as a gift and the 7 year rule applies.
