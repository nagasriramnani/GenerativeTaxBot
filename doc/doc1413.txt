You can pay at a branch by cash or cheque.

You’ll need your HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) payslip. You’ll find this on the payment request HMRC sent you.

If you pay between Monday and Friday, HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it, and not the date it reaches HMRC’s account.

Make the cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’.
