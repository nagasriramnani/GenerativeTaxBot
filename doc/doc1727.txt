Claiming relief on re-imported exported goods

If you’ve exported goods and you re-import them, you may be able to claim back the VAT that you pay when you import them. If the goods were originally sent out of the UK temporarily – for example for exhibition, or because they were on sale or return and they were returned – there is no UK VAT due on import. Otherwise, you may be able to obtain Returned Goods Relief.
