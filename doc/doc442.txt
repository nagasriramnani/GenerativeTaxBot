What records to keep

You’ll need to keep records of:

all sales and income

all business expenses

VAT records if you’re registered for VAT

PAYE records if you employ people

records about your personal income

your grants, if you claimed through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - check how much you were paid if you made a claim

Why you keep records

You do not need to send your records in when you submit your tax return but you need to keep them so you can:

work out your profit or loss for your tax return

show them to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if asked

You must make sure your records are accurate.
