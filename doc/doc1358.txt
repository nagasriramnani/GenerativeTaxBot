If you get Widowed Parent’s Allowance

You may inherit Additional State Pension before you reach State Pension age. You’ll stop receiving it if your Widowed Parent’s Allowance ends.

You may receive it again when you reach State Pension age if you were over 45 when you were entitled to Widowed Parent’s Allowance.

If your Widowed Parent’s Allowance or Bereavement Allowance ended before you were 55, you’ll receive less Additional State Pension.

When you cannot inherit Additional State Pension

You cannot inherit your spouse or civil partner’s Additional State Pension if you remarry or form another civil partnership before you reach State Pension age.

The date you reach State Pension age also affects whether you can inherit Additional State Pension.
