Acquiring or creating a capital asset

If you acquire or create an expensive capital asset you may have to use the Capital Goods Scheme to adjust how much input tax you initially reclaimed in future years. The scheme applies when your capital spending, net of VAT is:

£250,000 or more on land or buildings, or on building or civil engineering works

£50,000 or more on a single computer or piece of computer equipment

£50,000 or more on an aircraft, ship, boat or other vessel

You’ll have to adjust the amount of VAT you reclaimed if your business has an asset, and the extent to which you use it to make taxable supplies (rather than exempt supplies) varies over the following 5 or 10 years (depending on the asset).
