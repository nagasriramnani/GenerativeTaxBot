If the charity or CASC gets back more tax than you’ve paid, HMRC may ask you to pay more tax to cover the difference.

You pay Income Tax above the 20% basic rate

You can claim back the difference between the tax you’ve paid on the donation and what the charity got back when you fill in your Self Assessment tax return.

If you do not fill in a Self Assessment tax return, call HMRC to tell them about your charity donations.

You get Married Couple’s Allowance

Your tax-free allowance may increase if you make donations through Gift Aid and claim Married Couple’s Allowance.

If you fill in a Self Assessment tax return, your allowance will be adjusted automatically if it needs to be.

If you do not, call HMRC to tell them about your charity donations.
