isn’t needed for future use in the business

If part of a non-qualifying asset is used in the business, that part might qualify for Business Relief.

Example
If you use one room in a building as a shop and the other rooms are used as your home, the shop will qualify for Business Relief but the rooms won’t.

Relief for agricultural property

You may be able to get Business Relief on a transfer of agricultural property (eg farmland, buildings or farm equipment) which isn’t eligible for agricultural relief.
