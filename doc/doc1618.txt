Charging VAT

Once you’ve registered you must charge VAT at the correct rate on everything you supply.

Reclaiming VAT

If you’re registered you may be able to reclaim VAT when you file your VAT Return.

You can reclaim the VAT you were charged on goods and services relating to your taxable business activities.

Exports outside the UK

If you supply goods outside the UK free of charge (for example as aid), you can treat this as a zero-rate business activity (0% VAT) so you can reclaim the VAT on any associated costs.
