The home inherited by direct descendants does not have to be worth more than the basic or transferred basic threshold, to get the residence nil rate band.

You apply the residence nil rate band to the whole taxable estate, not just to the value of the home, so the whole estate shares the benefit of the tax-free residence allowance.

If the home is worth less than the maximum available residence nil rate band, you cannot set the unused amount against the other assets in the estate. But, the unused amount would be available to transfer to their spouse or civil partner’s estate when they die and leave a home to their direct descendants.

Example

A woman dies in the tax year 2020 to 2021 leaving:

a flat worth £100,000, and other assets of £400,000 to her son
