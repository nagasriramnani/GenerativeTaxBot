How it’s set up

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will automatically collect what you owe through your tax code if you meet all 3 conditions, unless you’ve specifically asked them not to (on your tax return).

If you’re not eligible, you will not be able to pay this way.

When you cannot pay through your tax code

You will not be able to pay your tax bill through your PAYE tax code if:

you do not have enough PAYE income for HMRC to collect it

you’d pay more than 50% of your PAYE income in tax

you’d end up paying more than twice as much tax as you normally do

you owed £3,000 or more but made a part payment to reduce the amount you owe to less than £3,000
