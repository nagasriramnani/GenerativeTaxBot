Telling HMRC

You have 14 days to tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) after you bring a vehicle into the UK permanently. You cannot register the vehicle until you’ve done this.

How you tell HMRC will depend on:

if you’re importing it to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or to Northern Ireland

where you’re importing it from

You may be fined if you’re late telling HMRC.

If your vehicle has an engine of 48cc or less (7.2kw or less if it’s electric), you can register it without telling HMRC first.
