Register for Self Assessment

If you do not usually send a tax return, you need to register by 5 October following the tax year you had the income.

You’ll get a letter telling you what to do next after you’ve registered.

Filling in your tax return

Use the ‘foreign’ section of the tax return to record your overseas income or gains.

Include income that’s already been taxed abroad to get Foreign Tax Credit Relief, if you’re eligible.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has guidance on how to report your foreign income or gains in your tax return in ‘Foreign notes’.
