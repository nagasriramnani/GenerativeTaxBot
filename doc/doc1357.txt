If your spouse or civil partner died within 90 days of topping up their State Pension, the top up should have been refunded to their estate (their total property, money and possessions), minus any payments they received before they died. This means you will not inherit the top up as part of their Additional State Pension.

How it’s paid

Any Additional State Pension you inherit will be paid on top of your State Pension when you reach State Pension age.

If you get your own Additional State Pension

The maximum amount of Additional State Pension you can get is £203.85 per week. The limit does not include State Pension top up.

If you get Widowed Parent’s Allowance
