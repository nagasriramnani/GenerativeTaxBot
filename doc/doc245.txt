You will only make repayments on the income from the job that pays you £2,300 a month because it’s above the £2,274 threshold.

If your income changes during the year

You can ask for a refund if you make repayments during the year, but your annual income at the end of the tax year is less than the annual threshold for your plan type.

If you’re self-employed

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will work out how much you repay each year from your tax return. Your repayments will be based on your income for the whole year.

If you’ve already made repayments from a salary, HMRC will deduct them from the amount you have to repay.
