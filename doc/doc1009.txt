Intermediaries

Intermediaries provide a service of arranging or facilitating the supply of goods or services. They’re often called brokers or agents, and their customer is the person or organisation who they supply their service to. This can be the supplier or the buyer of the goods or services, or both.

If you’re an intermediary, then the place of supply of your services depends on whether your customer is in business.

The rule for working out the place of supply of intermediary services is if you supply intermediary services to a:

business customer, the place of supply is the place where the customer belongs

non-business customer, the place of supply is the same as the place of supply of the service you’re arranging
