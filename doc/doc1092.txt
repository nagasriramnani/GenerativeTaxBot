Change of name or address

You need to tell HMRC if you’ve changed your name or address. How you contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to update your name or address depends on your situation.

You’ll also need to change your business records if you run a business.

If you submit a Self Assessment tax return, your details will be updated once you’ve reported a name or address change.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
