Update your personal tax account or call HMRC again if the amount you get in tips changes substantially. This will help stop you paying too much or too little tax over the year.

Tips paid through work

You do not have to report tips:

passed on by your employer, for example, discretionary tips customers added to their bill payments

paid through a separate system for managing and sharing out tips at your workplace (known as a ‘tronc’)

Any Income Tax you owe on these tips will be deducted when you get paid.

Whether you have to pay National Insurance depends on how much your employer is involved in deciding how the tips are shared out.

If you have to pay National Insurance your employer will deduct it when you get paid.
