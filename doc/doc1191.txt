How to apply

Download and fill in the application form.

Send or take your completed form to your nearest court that deals with bankruptcy.

You must tell the court if you want details of your bankruptcy removed from the Land Charges register.

You’ll be given a date for a court hearing of your application, which you must attend.

You’ll still need to attend your interview with the official receiver if you’ve been asked to.

If the court agrees with your application, they’ll make an annulment order which cancels your bankruptcy.

Advertise your cancellation order

You can ask the official receiver to advertise your annulment order within 28 days of getting it. You cannot do this if your bankruptcy order has not been advertised yet.
