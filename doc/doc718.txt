When you may be able to get a VAT refund

You can sometimes get VAT refunds on goods you buy in Northern Ireland if you:

visit Northern Ireland and live outside Northern Ireland and the EU

work or study in Northern Ireland but normally live outside Northern Ireland and the EU

live in Northern Ireland but are leaving Northern Ireland and the EU for at least 12 months

You can only get a VAT refund if you take the goods out of Northern Ireland and the EU within 3 months of buying them. Not all retailers offer VAT refunds.

Taking goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain

You will not get a VAT refund if you travel from Northern Ireland straight to Great Britain or to Great Britain through any EU country, including the Republic of Ireland.
