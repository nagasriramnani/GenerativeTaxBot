Claiming for an asset that’s lost its value

You can claim losses on assets that you still own if they become worthless or of ‘negligible value’.

HMRC has guidance on how to make a negligible value claim.

Special rules

HMRC has guidance on the special rules for losses:

when someone dies

if you’re non-resident and sell UK property or land

if you’ve temporarily lived abroad as a ‘non-resident’

from your income on shares that are unquoted or in the Enterprise Investment Scheme

on overseas assets if you’re ‘non-domiciled’ in the UK and have claimed the ‘remittance basis’
