Vehicles

You might be able to reclaim all the VAT on a new car or commercial vehicle if you use it only for business. You must be able to show that it is not used on a personal basis, for example it’s specified in your employee’s contract.

‘Personal use’ includes travelling between home and work, unless it’s a temporary place of work.

You might also be able to claim all the VAT on a new car if it’s mainly used:

as a taxi

for driving instruction

for self-drive hire

If you buy a used car for business use, the sales invoice must show the VAT.

If you hire a car to replace a company car that’s off the road, you can usually claim 50% of the VAT on the hire charge.

If you hire a car for business use only, you can reclaim all the VAT if you hire it for no more than 10 days.
