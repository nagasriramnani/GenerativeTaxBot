Report gains to HMRC

Trustees must report and pay any tax due on UK residential property using a Capital Gains Tax on UK property account. They must do this within:

60 days of selling the property if the completion date was on or after 27 October 2021

30 days of selling the property if the completion date was between 6 April 2020 and 26 October 2021

Trustees must report the sale or transfer of other assets in a trust and estate Self Assessment tax return.

Download and fill in a Trust and Estate Tax Capital Gains form (SA905) if you’re a trustee sending a tax return by post.

The rules are different for reporting a loss.
