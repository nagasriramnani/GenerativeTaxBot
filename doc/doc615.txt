Respond to a money claim

You must respond if someone claims you owe them money. You must respond by the date on the email or letter you receive.

There’s a different process in Scotland.

If you do not respond

You might get a County Court Judgment (CCJ) if you do not respond by the date on the letter or email.

If you get a CCJ:

bailiffs might be sent to your home or business

you might have problems getting credit, such as a mobile phone contract, credit card or mortgage
