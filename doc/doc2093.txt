If you’re not resident in the UK for tax, you only pay tax on gains since 5 April 2015.

Deducting costs

You can deduct costs of buying, selling or improving your property from your gain. These include:

estate agents’ and solicitors’ fees

costs of improvement works, for example for an extension - normal maintenance costs like decorating do not count

You cannot deduct certain costs, like interest on a loan to buy your property. Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you’re not sure whether you can deduct a certain cost.

There are special rules for calculating your gain if you sell a lease or your home is compulsorily purchased.
