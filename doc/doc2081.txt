If you’re a non-UK resident and were stuck in the UK because of coronavirus (COVID-19) between 5 April 2020 and 5 April 2022

You will not have to pay UK tax on employment income if you:

earned it between the dates you intended to leave and when you left

paid tax on it in your home country

Example You missed your departure flight because you were self-isolating and you worked in the UK until you could rearrange a flight home. As long as you pay tax on your wages in your home country, you will not have to pay tax in the UK.

You must file a Self Assessment tax return, together with a completed SA109 form. Use the ‘other information’ section of your SA109 to include:

the dates you were stuck in the UK because of coronavirus

what you earned in that time
