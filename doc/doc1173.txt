Authorise a friend, relative or voluntary organisation to act as an intermediary

You can arrange for an ‘intermediary’ to deal with HMRC for you. You might do this if you’re ill, have a disability or do not speak English.

An intermediary can:

talk to HMRC and answer any questions on your behalf

help you to fill in forms

An intermediary will not have access to your tax online.

To authorise an intermediary to help deal with your tax, write to HMRC.

your signature
