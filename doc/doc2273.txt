If the original will is lost, you may be able to apply for probate with form PA13.

If there’s more than one executor

If more than one person is named as an executor, you must all agree who makes the application for probate.

Up to 4 executors can be named on the application.

If only one executor is named on the application they’ll need to prove that they tried to contact all executors named in the will before they applied.

If you’re having problems finding the other executors, you can contact the Probate Call Centre.
