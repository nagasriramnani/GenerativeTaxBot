Leaving an investment club

The club buys back your shares if you leave, and you need to include any gain or loss when you’re working out if you need to pay tax.

Take your share of any gains during your membership of the club, and deduct your share of any losses.

Add any income from dividends you received (after tax).

Add any other money you received from the club, and deduct anything you paid into it (for example a monthly amount to invest).

Deduct the total from what you received from the club for your shares.

Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or get professional help (for example from an accountant) if you need advice.

Transferring shares into the club

If you transfer shares you already own into the club, you’re treated as selling them and you need to work out your gain.
