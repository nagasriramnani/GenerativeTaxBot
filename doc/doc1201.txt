You do not have to use flat rates for all your vehicles. Once you use the flat rates for a vehicle, you must continue to do so as long as you use that vehicle for your business.

You can claim all other travel expenses (for example train journeys) and parking on top of your vehicle expenses.

Use the simplified expenses checker to compare what you can claim using simplified expenses with what you can claim by working out the actual costs.
