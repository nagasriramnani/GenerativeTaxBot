VAT registered businesses

You can start to use cash basis if you’re VAT registered as long as your income is £150,000 or less during the tax year.

You can record your business income and expenses either excluding or including VAT. However, you must treat income and expenses the same way.

If you choose to include VAT, you have to record:

VAT payments you make to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)  as expenses

VAT repayments you receive from HMRC as income
