If you’re applying for a mortgage, you’ll need a Certificate of Discharge.

How you get it depends on how you applied for your bankruptcy.

If you applied:

at a court, contact the court and pay the £75 fee (£11 for each copy)

online, email the Insolvency Service - there’s no fee

Bankruptcy registers

The Individual Insolvency Register is updated within 3 months of your discharge.

You must apply to both Land Charges and HM Land Registry to have your bankruptcy entry removed from any properties you still own after paying your debts.
