Find the original will

You’ll need to send the original will with your probate application - you cannot use a photocopy. The probate registry will keep the will and it’ll become a public record.

The person who died should have told all the executors where to find the original will and any updates, for example:

at their house

with a probate practitioner, such as a solicitor

at the national probate registry in Newcastle - you’ll need the death certificate and evidence you’re the executor

Get help from Citizens Advice or a probate practitioner (such as a solicitor) if you cannot understand a will.

If there’s more than one will, send in the most recent one. Do not destroy any copies of earlier wills until you’ve received probate.
