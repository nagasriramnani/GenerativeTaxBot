What VAT is charged on

VAT is charged on things like:

goods and services (a service is anything other than supplying goods)

hiring or loaning goods to someone

selling business assets

commission

items sold to staff - for example canteen meals

business goods used for personal reasons

‘non-sales’ like bartering, part-exchange and gifts

These are known as ‘taxable supplies’. There are different rules for charities.

VAT is not charged on goods or services that are exempt from VAT or are unaffected by VAT (‘out of scope’).
