Tell HMRC about a change in income

You can report a change in your income by either:

using the check your Income Tax online service

contacting HMRC

If you’re contacting HMRC on someone else’s behalf

If you need to tell HMRC about a change in someone else’s income (for example, because you’re their accountant) fill in a PAYE Coding Notice query form.

After you report your change

HMRC will contact you if they change your tax code.

They will also tell your employer or pension provider that your tax code has changed.

Your next payslip should show:

your new tax code

adjustments to your pay if you were paying the wrong amount of tax
