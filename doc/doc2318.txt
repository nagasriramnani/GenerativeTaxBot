You should speak to a financial adviser if you’re unsure whether you should make extra repayments or not.

If you decide to make an extra repayment, you can choose how it is applied to your loan. For example, you can use it to reduce the total balance of your loan or to reduce the balance of a specific plan (if you have more than one plan).

If you do not choose how the repayment is applied, the Student Loans Company (SLC) will decide how it’s applied for you.

If you’re a full time student from Wales, you may be able to get £1,500 of your Maintenance Loan written off.
