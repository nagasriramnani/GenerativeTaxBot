‘county court and family court bailiffs’

bailiffs who enforce magistrates’ court fines and warrants for arrests (either ‘civilian enforcement officers’ or ‘Approved Enforcement Agents’)

A bailiff may also visit your home for other reasons, for example to serve court documents or give notices and summons.

An Approved Enforcement Agent can arrest you if there’s a warrant for your arrest for breaking a community penalty order.

Bailiffs must usually give you at least 7 days’ notice of their first visit.

There’s a different process in Scotland.

Pay what you owe before a bailiff visits

If you think a bailiff might visit you to collect debts, you can stop this by paying the money you owe. Get advice about how to pay your debt from whoever you owe money to as soon as possible.
