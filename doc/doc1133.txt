Change to your business

You must tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if certain things about your business change.

Changes to your business’s legal structure

You must tell HMRC if you decide to change the legal structure of your business, for example if you become a limited company or set up a partnership.

As well as registering under your new structure, you’ll need to tell HMRC if you stop being self employed or close a limited company.

To close a partnership, the nominated partner needs to report this on the final partnership tax return.
