Share Incentive Plans (SIPs)

If you get shares through a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and keep them in the plan for 5 years you will not pay Income Tax or National Insurance on their value.

You will not pay Capital Gains Tax on shares you sell if you keep them in the plan until you sell them.

If you take them out of the plan, keep them and then sell them later on, you might have to pay Capital Gains Tax if their value has increased.

There are 4 ways you can get shares under SIPs.
