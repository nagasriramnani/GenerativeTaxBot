If the trust is set up by a will

Someone might ask that some or all of their assets are put into a trust. This is called a ‘will trust’.

The personal representative of the deceased person has to make sure that the trust is properly set up with all taxes paid, and the trustees make sure that Inheritance Tax is paid on any future charges.

If the deceased transferred assets into a trust before they died

If you’re valuing the estate of someone who has died, you’ll need to find out whether they made any transfers in the 7 years before they died. If they did, and they paid 20% Inheritance Tax, you’ll need to pay an extra 20% from the estate.
