Tax-free shopping

You can only buy tax-free goods from shops:

in Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) if they’re delivered straight to an address outside the UK

in Northern Ireland if they’re delivered straight to an address outside the UK and the EU

Check with the retailer if they offer this service.

If you’re visiting Northern Ireland, you may also be able to claim tax back on goods you buy from certain shops. You claim this as a VAT refund when you leave Northern Ireland or the EU.
