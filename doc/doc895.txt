Emergency tax codes

If you’re on an emergency tax code your payslip will show:

1257 W1

1257 M1

1257 X

These mean you’ll pay tax on all your income above the basic Personal Allowance.

You may be put on an emergency tax code if HMRC does not get your income details in time after a change in circumstances such as:

a new job

working for an employer after being self-employed

getting company benefits or the State Pension
