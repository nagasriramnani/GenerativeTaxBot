More than one business or trade

If youâ€™re a sole trader or a partnership and you have more than one business or trade, each business usually gets an AIA.

You only get one AIA if the businesses are both:

controlled by the same person

in the same premises or have similar activities

If 2 or more limited companies are controlled by the same person they only get one AIA between them. They can choose how to share the AIA.
