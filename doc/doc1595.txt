You can only send it by registered post or put it through a letterbox if it cannot be delivered in person.

Records you must keep

You must keep a copy of the statutory demand and anything that confirms:

the time and date you served the statutory demand, for example a postage receipt or confirmation from your process server

the debtor has received the statutory demand

You’ll need this information if your demand is ignored.

If your demand is ignored

If your debtor does not pay the debt or agree to your statutory demand within 21 days, you can:

start bankruptcy proceedings against any individuals who owe you £5,000 or more

wind up a company that owes you £750 or more
