Register if you’re self-employed

You must register if you’re self-employed as a ‘sole trader’ and earned more than £1,000 before tax relief in the last tax year (6 April to 5 April).

If you have any untaxed income, like money from renting out a property, you may also have to register.

Check if you need to register and send a tax return.

You need to register for both:

Self Assessment

Class 2 National Insurance

If you did not send a tax return last year, you’ll need to register again.

When to register

Register by 5 October in your business’s second tax year. You could be fined if you do not.
