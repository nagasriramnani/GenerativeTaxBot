you have one home and you’ve lived in it as your main home for all the time you’ve owned it

you have not let part of it out - this does not include having a lodger

you have not used a part of your home exclusively for business purposes (using a room as a temporary or occasional office does not count as exclusive business use)

the grounds, including all buildings, are less than 5,000 square metres (just over an acre) in total

you did not buy it just to make a gain
