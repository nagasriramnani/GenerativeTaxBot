When bankruptcy ends

Cancel a bankruptcy

You can apply to cancel (‘annul’) your bankruptcy if:

the bankruptcy order should not have been made

all your debts and bankruptcy fees have been paid or secured (guaranteed) by a third party

you‘ve made an Individual Voluntary Arrangement with your creditors to pay all or part of your debts

If your circumstances change and you can pay off all your debts, then you must pay it through your official receiver or a solicitor.

This means you will not have to follow the bankruptcy restrictions.
