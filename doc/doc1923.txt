Before you apply

To use this service, you’ll need your National Insurance number and your partner’s National Insurance number.

If you have come to the UK and you do not plan to work or study, you cannot get a National Insurance number. Phone the Income Tax helpline to apply for Marriage Allowance.

You’ll need to sign in using your Government Gateway user ID and password.

You’ll have to prove your identity to register for Government Gateway if you have not used it before.

You can use your National Insurance number or postcode and 2 of the following:

a valid UK passport

a UK photocard driving licence issued by the DVLA (or DVA in Northern Ireland)

a payslip from the last 3 months or a P60 from your employer for the last tax year

details of a tax credit claim if you made one
