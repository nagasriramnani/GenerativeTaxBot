Inheritance Tax

You do not usually pay Inheritance Tax on a lump sum because payment is usually ‘discretionary’ - this means the pension provider can choose whether to pay it to you.

Ask the pension provider if payment of the lump sum was discretionary. If it was not, you may have to pay Inheritance Tax.

If you paid too much tax

If you fill in a Self Assessment tax return each year, you’ll get a refund when you’ve sent your return.
