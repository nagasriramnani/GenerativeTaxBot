Pay the tax you owe

Midnight 31 January 2024

There’s usually a second payment deadline of 31 July if you make advance payments towards your bill (known as ‘payments on account’).

You’ll usually pay a penalty if you’re late. You can appeal against a penalty if you have a reasonable excuse.

When the deadline is different

Submit your online return by 30 December if you want HMRC to automatically collect tax you owe from your wages and pension. Find out if you are eligible to pay this way.

HMRC must receive a paper tax return by 31 January if you’re a trustee of a registered pension scheme or a non-resident company. You cannot send a return online.

HMRC might also email or write to you giving you a different deadline.
