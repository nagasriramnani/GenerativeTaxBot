To make weekly or monthly Direct Debit payments towards your next Self Assessment tax bill, set up a Budget Payment Plan.

Find the reference number for your Direct Debit

You’ll need to use your 11-character payment reference. This is your 10-digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) followed by the letter ‘K’.

You’ll find it either:

in your HMRC online account

on your paying-in slip, if you get paper statements

Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.

Allow 5 working days to process a Direct Debit the first time you set one up. It should take 3 working days the next time if you’re using the same bank details.
