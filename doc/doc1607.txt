Repayment interest is paid at the Bank of England base rate minus 1%, with a minimum rate of 0.5%.

Repayments to an overseas bank account

You can only get VAT repayments paid into an overseas bank account if your company:

does not have a UK bank account (and youâ€™re unable to get one)

does not have a UK address

For HMRC to make a payment into your overseas bank account, it must be:

in the name of the company owed a repayment

associated with a named business owner or an authorised person with a Government Gateway ID

able to accept repayments in pounds sterling

You must fill in a form to give details of your overseas bank account before HMRC can transfer any VAT repayments. All VAT repayments will then be sent to this bank account.
