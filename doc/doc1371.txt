The remaining £3,430 of your wages (£16,000 minus £12,570) reduces your starting rate for savings by £3,430.

Your remaining starting rate for savings is £1,570 (£5,000 minus £3,430). This means you will not have to pay tax on your £200 savings interest.

You may also get up to £1,000 of interest and not have to pay tax on it, depending on which Income Tax band you’re in. This is your Personal Savings Allowance.
