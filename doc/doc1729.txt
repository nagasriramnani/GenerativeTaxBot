Deferring import VAT payments

For larger payments, if you’re a regular importer, you can defer paying import duty and VAT by setting up an account with HMRC. Setting up a deferment account is free of charge, but you’ll need to arrange a bank guarantee. If HMRC authorises you to use Simplified Import VAT Accounting this guarantee can be reduced.

Temporary imports

If you import goods on a temporary basis, you may not need to pay some or all of the import duty or VAT.

Goods stored under customs warehousing

If you import goods and store them under an inventory system known as a customs warehouse, payment of import duties or VAT can be suspended. A wide range of goods can be stored using a customs warehouse.
