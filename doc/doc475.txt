You need to make a separate claim for each tax year.

Accumulation or discretionary trusts

With these trusts all income received by beneficiaries is treated as though it has already been taxed at 45%. If you’re an additional rate taxpayer there will be no more tax to pay.

You may be able to claim tax back on trust income you’ve received if any of the following apply:

you’re a non-taxpayer

you pay tax at the basic rate of 20%

you pay tax at the higher rate of 40%

You can reclaim the tax paid using form R40. If you complete a tax return, you can claim through Self Assessment.
