If the adjudicator makes you bankrupt:

you’ll receive a copy of the bankruptcy order  and may be interviewed about your situation

your assets can be used to pay your debts

you’ll have to follow the bankruptcy restrictions

your name and details will be published in the Individual Insolvency Register

You can apply to have your address removed from the Individual Insolvency Register if publishing it will put you at risk of violence. This will not affect your bankruptcy.

After 12 months you’re usually released (‘discharged’) (‘discharged’) from your bankruptcy restrictions and debts. Assets that were part of your estate during the bankruptcy period can still be used to pay your debts.

You might be able to cancel (‘annul’) your bankruptcy before you’re discharged.
