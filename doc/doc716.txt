Payroll Giving schemes

If your employer or pension provider offers a Payroll Giving scheme, any donations you give through the scheme will be taken before Income Tax is taken off.

Youâ€™ll still pay National Insurance contributions on the amount of your donation. But you will not pay any Income Tax on the amount you donate.
