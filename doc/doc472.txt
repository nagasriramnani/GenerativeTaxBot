how much tax has been paid on the income

You’ll usually get income sent through the trustees, but they might pass it to you directly without paying tax first. If this happens you need to include it on your Self Assessment tax return.

If you do not usually send a tax return you must register for Self Assessment by 5 October the year after you were given the income.

Example

You were given income from the trust in August 2022. You need to register for Self Assessment before 5 October 2023.

If you’re a basic rate taxpayer

You will not owe any extra tax. You’ll still need to complete a Self Assessment tax return to show the income you receive from an interest in possession trust but you will get a credit for the tax paid by the trustees. This means the income is not taxed twice.
