A trust for a bereaved young person can also be set up as an 18 to 25 trust - the 10-yearly charges do not apply. However, the main differences are:

the beneficiary must become fully entitled to the assets in the trust by the age of 25

when the beneficiary is aged between 18 and 25, Inheritance Tax exit charges may apply

Trusts for disabled beneficiaries

There’s no 10-yearly charge or exit charge on this type of trust as long as the asset stays in the trust and remains the ‘interest’ of the beneficiary.

You also do not have to pay Inheritance Tax on the transfer of assets into a trust for a disabled person as long as the person making the transfer survives for 7 years after making the transfer.

Paying Inheritance Tax
