Possessions with a limited lifespan

You don’t have to pay Capital Gains Tax on personal possessions with a lifespan of less than 50 years. This covers all machinery, and includes things like antique clocks or watches.

Different rules apply if you’ve used the possession for business. You don’t have to pay Capital Gains Tax if it doesn’t qualify for capital allowances. If it qualifies, you may need to pay Capital Gains Tax, but you can’t claim losses.
