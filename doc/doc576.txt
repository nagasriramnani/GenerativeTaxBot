Items you use outside your business

For items that are in a single asset pool because you’ve used them outside your business, reduce the amount you can claim by the amount you use them privately.

You still deduct the full amount from your pool to get the closing balance.

Example

You have a single asset pool for a car that qualifies for the main rate (18%). The opening balance is £10,000. You use the car for your family for half the time.

If you did not use it outside your business, you could’ve claimed £1,800 (18% of £10,000) for the car. Because you use it for your family half the time, you can only claim £900 (half of £1,800).

You still deduct the full amount of capital allowances (£1,800) from your balance - even though you can only claim half of them (£900) on your tax return.
