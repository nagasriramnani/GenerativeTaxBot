by some other legal means

The home does not have to be specifically mentioned in the person’s will. It can be inherited as part of what’s left of the estate (the residue) after taking specific legacies into account.

The residue of the estate is what’s left after payment of:

debts such as mortgages and loans

funeral expenses

executor’s fees

taxes

other expenses from administering the estate

any specific gifts or legacies in the will

Where the home forms part of the residue and the residue has passed on to a number of different people, HMRC treat each of them as inheriting a proportion of the home.

For the residence nil rate band, inheriting the home only counts if the direct descendants become entitled to the home when the person dies.
