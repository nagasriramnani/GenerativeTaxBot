How VAT retail schemes work

If you sell goods you must calculate how much VAT to record in your VAT account.

For goods sold inclusive of VAT, you must deduct the VAT you have to record. For goods sold exclusive of VAT, you must add it.

VAT retail schemes can make calculating your VAT simpler. Instead of calculating the VAT for each sale you make, you do it once with each VAT return.

There are 3 standard VAT retail schemes:

Point of Sale Scheme - you identify and record the VAT at the time of sale

Apportionment Scheme - you buy goods for resale
