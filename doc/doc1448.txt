Overview

You must pay Inheritance Tax by the end of the sixth month after the person died. For example, if the person died in January, you must pay Inheritance Tax by 31 July.

There are different due dates if youâ€™re making payments on a trust.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will charge you interest if you do not pay by the due date.
