You can get rid of penalty points by submitting future returns on time.

If you make a late payment

You could get a penalty if you pay late:

on your VAT Return

following an amendment to a return or correction

from a VAT assessment HMRC issued when you did not submit your return

from a VAT assessment HMRC issued for another reason

How much you’ll be charged depends on how late you pay.

The penalty amount goes up after 16 days, and then again after 31 days.

You’ll be charged late payment interest from the first day your payment is overdue, until you pay in full. This also applies if you’re paying in instalments.
