Call HMRC on someone else’s behalf

If the person you’re helping cannot go online, you can call HMRC on their behalf and talk to them about any tax issue.

You must be in the same room as the person you’re helping. HMRC will confirm their identity and check that they’re happy for you to represent them.

You must have their National Insurance number or tax reference number when you call.
