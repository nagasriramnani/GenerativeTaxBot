a detailed breakdown of the amount owed

You can ask for proof of a bailiff’s identity and authorisation even if they’ve visited before - for example, ask them to put it through the letterbox or show it at the window.

All bailiffs must have a certificate unless they’re exempt or they’re with someone who does have a certificate.

Anyone who claims to be a bailiff when they are not is committing fraud.

To check a bailiff’s identity, find out what kind of bailiff they are from their proof of identity and then:

check the register of certificated bailiffs if they say they’re a certificated enforcement agent (contact the county court business centre if you have a question)

check the list if they say they’re a high court enforcement officer
