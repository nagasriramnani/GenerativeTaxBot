Calculate the net value of errors

To work out the net value of the errors:

add up the additional tax due to HMRC

subtract the tax youâ€™re due

You must report deliberate errors separately - you cannot include them in this calculation.

How to make the adjustment

When you submit your next return, add the net value to box 1 for tax due to HMRC, or to box 4 for tax due to you.

Or you can tell HMRC about errors in your VAT return by filling in either:

the online form

form VAT652

You must:

keep details about the error (for example, the date it was discovered, how it happened and the amount of VAT involved)

include the value of the error in your VAT account
