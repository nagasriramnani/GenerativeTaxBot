Work out if you need to pay

You need to pay Capital Gains Tax when you sell an asset if your total taxable gains are above your annual Capital Gains Tax allowance.

Work out your total taxable gains

Work out the gain for each asset (or your share of an asset if it’s jointly owned). Do this for the personal possessions, shares or investments , UK property or business assets you’ve disposed of in the tax year.

Add together the gains from each asset.
