The amount in your Budget Payment Plan will be used against your next tax bill - this means you’ll have less to pay at the payment deadline. If the amount in your plan does not cover your next bill in full, you’ll need to pay the difference. If you’re in credit, you can request a refund.

When you set up your Budget Payment Plan, you’ll choose how much you want to pay and how often.

You can pause payments for up to 6 months if you need to.

To use the Budget Payment Plan, you must be up to date with your previous Self Assessment payments.
