Apply for Marriage Allowance

Marriage Allowance lets you transfer £1,260 of your Personal Allowance to your husband, wife or civil partner. It’s free to apply for Marriage Allowance.

This can reduce their tax by up to £252 every tax year (6 April to 5 April the next year).

To benefit as a couple, you need to earn less than your partner and have an income of £12,570 or less. Your partner’s income must be between £12,571 and £50,270 (£43,662 in Scotland) for you to be eligible.

You can backdate your claim to include any tax year since 5 April 2018 that you were eligible for Marriage Allowance. If your partner has since died you can still claim - phone the Income Tax helpline.

This service is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
