If you sell 150 shares, the cost of the shares for your tax calculations is £165 (£1.10 multiplied by 150). Deduct this from what you sold the shares for to work out your gain.

If you bought new shares of the same type in the same company within 30 days of selling your old ones, there are special rules for working out the cost to use in your tax calculations.

Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or get professional tax help if you need advice.
