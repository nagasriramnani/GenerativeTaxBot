Tenants in common

You may have to pay Inheritance Tax on the deceased’s share of the money in bank accounts, shares or property if the whole of their estate (money, property and possessions) is worth more than the Inheritance Tax threshold of £325,000.

If the deceased left you their share of the money, shares or property in their will, the executor of the will or administrator of their estate should pay the Inheritance Tax out of the estate.

If the estate does not have enough money to pay the Inheritance Tax on the deceased’s share of the assets, or the executor does not pay, you’ll have to pay it. You may have to sell the shares or property to pay the tax and any other debts.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will contact you if you need to pay.
