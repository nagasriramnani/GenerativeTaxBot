She has an estate worth £1.8 million, including her home worth £500,000. She leaves all of this to her children.

The amount of residence nil rate band available to transfer to her estate is:

maximum residence nil rate band in tax year 2020 to 2021

£175,000

multiplied by the unused percentage

x 60%

residence nil rate band to transfer

£105,000
