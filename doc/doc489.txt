Prove your identity

If you can, you’ll need to take and upload:

a photo of yourself holding your passport

photos of other identity documents

You can use a smartphone, tablet or a digital camera.

You’ll be told how to take the photos and what they must look like during the application process.

You can ask someone to take the photos for you.

If you cannot upload photos

You can still apply online but your application will take longer.

You may need to attend an appointment or post photocopies of your documents. You’ll get an email telling you what to do after you’ve submitted your application.
