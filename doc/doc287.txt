If your records are lost, stolen or destroyed

If you cannot replace your records, you must do your best to provide figures. Tell HMRC when you file your tax return if you’re using:

estimated figures - your best guess when you cannot provide the actual figures

provisional figures - your temporary estimated figures while you wait for actual figures (you’ll also need to submit actual figures when available)
