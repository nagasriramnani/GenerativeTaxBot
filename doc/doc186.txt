Paper tax returns

For the main Self Assessment tax return, call HMRC and request form SA100. You can download all other forms and supplementary pages.

You then need to send HMRC the corrected pages. Write ‘amendment’ on each page, and include your name and Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) - this is on previous tax returns or letters from HMRC.

Check your Self Assessment paperwork for the address. If you cannot find this, send your corrections to the address for general Self Assessment enquiries.

If you used commercial software

Contact the software provider for help correcting your tax return. Contact HMRC if your software is not able to make corrections.
