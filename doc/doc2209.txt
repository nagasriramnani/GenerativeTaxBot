Any bankruptcy petitions the creditor has already filed against you will usually be suspended until the court reaches a decision.

The court will not usually set aside a statutory demand if it was served on you following the judgment of another court unless, for example:

you think the creditor owes you the same amount as your debt, or more

the amount on the statutory demand is secured

Deadlines

You must apply to challenge the statutory demand within either:

18 days if you were in the UK when you got the statutory demand

21 to 34 days if you were in another country when you got the statutory demand - check the table of countries for specific deadlines

If the deadline is during a weekend or on a bank holiday, you have until the next day the court is open to apply.
