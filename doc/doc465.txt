How to register for VAT

Register for VAT

You can usually register for VAT online.

You need a Government Gateway user ID and password to register for VAT. If you do not already have a user ID you can create one when you sign in for the first time.

Registering for VAT also creates a VAT online account.

Using an agent

You can appoint an accountant (or agent) to submit your VAT Returns and deal with HMRC on your behalf.
