Double Taxation Relief

Double Taxation Relief is given in accordance with the terms of the relevant double taxation convention. If you have paid tax in an overseas country and the relief is due, they will give you a credit for the tax paid overseas against the Inheritance Tax due in the UK on the same assets on which the overseas tax was paid. The relief will be limited to the actual amount of overseas tax paid on those assets.

Example

Brian died on 6 May 2014, leaving an estate of £500,000. His estate included an apartment in America valued at £35,000 on which American tax of £1,500 was paid.
