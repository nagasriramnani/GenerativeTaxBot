Use an insolvency practitioner to get an  IVA.

Your insolvency practitioner works out what you can afford to repay and how long the IVA lasts. You’ll have to give details about your financial situation, for example your assets, debts, income and creditors.

Your insolvency practitioner will contact your creditors. The IVA will start if the creditors holding 75% of your debts agree to it. It will apply to all your creditors, including any who disagreed to it.

An IVA will stop your creditors taking action against you for your debts.

Costs

There are usually 2 fees:

a set up fee

a handling fee each time you make a payment

Make sure you know how much it’s going to cost before asking an insolvency practitioner to act for you.
