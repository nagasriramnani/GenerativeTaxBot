You must declare VAT on the deposit when you receive it, or when you issue a VAT invoice, whichever happens first.

If you keep a deposit if your customer decides not to take up the goods or service, VAT remains due on the money you have received.

Using the cash accounting scheme

If you use the cash accounting scheme you’ll account for the VAT when you receive payment from your customers unless it’s a returnable deposit.

Payments for continuous supplies

If you supply services on a continuous basis and you receive regular or occasional payments, a tax point is created every time you issue a VAT invoice or receive a payment, whichever happens first.
