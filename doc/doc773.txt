Registering an imported vehicle

You must register any vehicle you bring into the UK permanently. You cannot register before you do all of the following:

tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) you imported the vehicle and get confirmation that your NOVA application is processed

pay VAT and duty if HMRC tells you to

get proof of vehicle approval

You also tax the vehicle when you register it with DVLA - there’s a £55 fee.
