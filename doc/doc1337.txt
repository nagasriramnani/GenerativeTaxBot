Pay tax if you go above your lifetime allowance

You’ll get a statement from your pension provider telling you how much tax you owe if you go above your lifetime allowance. Your pension provider will deduct the tax before you start getting your pension.

You’ll need to report the tax deducted by filling in a Self Assessment tax return - download and fill in form SA101 if you’re using paper forms. You’ll get information from your pension provider to help you do this.

If you took your pension on or after 6 April 2023, there is no lifetime allowance tax charge and you do not need to report the tax deducted on your Self Assessment tax return.

If you die before taking your pension the pension provider will take tax from the person who inherits your pension.
