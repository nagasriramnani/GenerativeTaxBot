If you need to pay a VAT surcharge or penalty

Write your 14-digit reference number beginning with ‘X’ on the back of your cheque.

You can find your 14-digit reference number in the letter HMRC sent you about your surcharge or penalty.

Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.

Allow 3 working days for your payment to reach HM Revenue and Customs’ bank account.
