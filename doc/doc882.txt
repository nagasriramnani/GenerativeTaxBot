When you will not count as living abroad

HMRC will treat you as being domiciled in the UK if you either:

lived in the UK for 15 of the last 20 years

had your permanent home in the UK at any time in the last 3 years of your life

Double-taxation treaties

Your executor might be able to reclaim tax through a double-taxation treaty if Inheritance Tax is charged on the same assets by the UK and the country where you lived.
