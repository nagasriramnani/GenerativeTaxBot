Deduct the amount you can claim from the pool to get the closing balance. This is known as the ‘tax written down value’.

Use the amount left in each pool as the opening balance for the next accounting period.

Example

The opening balance in your main pool is £9,000. You buy a machine worth £1,200. The total for this pool is then £10,200 (£9,000 plus £1,200).

You sell a desk for £200. The total for this pool is then £10,000 (£10,200 minus £200).

Apply the rate for the main pool (18%). The amount you can claim for this pool in this period is £1,800 (18% of £10,000).

The rest (£8,200) is your closing balance or tax written down value. This is carried over and becomes your opening balance in this pool for your next accounting period.
