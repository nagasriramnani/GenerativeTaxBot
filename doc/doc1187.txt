fees, eg for valuing or advertising

costs to improve your possession (but not repairs)

VAT (unless you can reclaim it)

You can’t deduct certain costs, including:

interest on a loan to buy your possession

costs you can claim as expenses, if you’ve used your possession for business

Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you’re not sure whether you can deduct a certain cost.

If you sold it for between £6,000 and £15,000

You may be able to reduce your gain if you got between £6,000 and £15,000 for your possession when you sold or disposed of it.

Subtract £6,000 from the amount you’ve received.

Multiply this by 1.667.

Compare this with the actual gain - use the lower amount as your capital gain.
