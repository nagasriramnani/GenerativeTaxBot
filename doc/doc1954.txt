Your agent will send you a link by email to request access to your Capital Gains Tax on UK property account.

If you accept the authorisation request, the agent will be able to report and manage the account and returns on your behalf.

Self Assessment tax returns

If you need to complete a Self Assessment tax return you must still fill in the Capital Gains section of your tax return for the year of the disposal, unless the gain is exempt due to Private Residence Relief.

Direct disposals of UK property or land

You must tell HMRC and may have to pay Capital Gains Tax when you sell or dispose of an interest in UK property or land.

There are different rates of Capital Gains Tax to pay depending on whether the direct disposal is for residential or non-residential UK property or land.
