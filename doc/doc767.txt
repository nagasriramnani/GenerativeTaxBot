When you can claim

You must claim in the accounting period you bought the item if you want to claim:

annual investment allowance

100% first year allowances

super-deduction or special rate first year allowance

If you do not want to claim the full value you can claim part of it using writing down allowances. You can do this at any time as long as you still own the item.

When you bought it

The date you bought it is:

when you signed the contract, if payment is due within less than 4 months

when payment’s due, if it’s due more than 4 months later

If you buy something under a hire purchase contract you can claim for the payments you have not made yet when you start using the item. You cannot claim on the interest payments.
