If you sell goods or services that are VAT exempt and are based in Northern Ireland

You’ll need to register if you only sell goods or services that are exempt from VAT or ‘out of scope’ but you buy goods for more than £85,000 from EU VAT-registered suppliers to use in your business.

If you take over a VAT-registered business

You must register for VAT if the combined taxable turnover of the new business and your existing business is over the threshold.

Calculate your turnover

Your turnover is the total value of everything you sell that is not exempt from VAT. It also includes:

zero-rated goods

goods you hired or loaned to customers

business goods used for personal reasons

goods you bartered, part-exchanged or gave as gifts
