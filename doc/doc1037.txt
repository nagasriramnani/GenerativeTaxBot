Appeal against an indirect tax decision

You’ll be offered a review by HMRC in its decision letter. You can either accept the offer of a review or appeal to the tax tribunal.

You’ll have 30 days from the date of the decision to accept the offer.

If customs has seized your things, you can ask for them back.
