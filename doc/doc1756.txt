Reclaiming input tax

You’ll only be able to reclaim the input tax shown on self-billed invoices if you meet all the record keeping requirements.

When you can reclaim the input tax depends on the date when the supply of the goods or services takes place for VAT purposes.

Normally the date of supply for VAT purposes is the actual date when the goods or services are provided to you, the customer. But if you issue a self-billed invoice within 14 days of this date of supply, then the date you issue the invoice becomes the date of the transaction for VAT purposes.

This determines which VAT Return you put the transaction on, and if there is a VAT rate change, it determines which VAT rate applies to the invoice.
