A bankruptcy restriction or notice is added to your property’s entry in the land register to say this.

It can only be removed if it’s been added to your property by mistake. Send HM Land Registry a signed statement saying you are not bankrupt and an application to change the register for a property.

Joint owners

The equity is transferred to your trustee.

A ‘Form J restriction’ is added to your property’s entry in the land register. This means your trustee will be told of any dealings connected with your home, for example if you try to sell it.
