you pay too much VAT

you reclaim too little VAT

a payment to you from HMRC was delayed

HMRC will not usually repay interest if you’ve paid too much VAT because of a mistake you made.

Interest is usually paid for the whole period from when the VAT was overpaid or reclaimed until the date repayment is authorised.

If you caused a delay to any payments (for example by not claiming straight away) HMRC might leave this time out.

You need to claim the interest separately from the repayment itself.

Write to HMRC with details of the repayment, explaining why you’re owed interest. You must do this within 4 years of the date HMRC authorised the original repayment. Use the postal address on the letter you received from HMRC about your VAT.
