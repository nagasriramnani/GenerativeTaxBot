Claim the interest

You can claim interest on the money you’re owed.

The interest will be calculated for you if you claim for an unspecified amount.

You need to work out the interest yourself if you’re claiming for a fixed (‘specified’) amount of money.

If you’re owed money by another business, you can charge interest on a late commercial payment.

For other types of debt, the rate is usually 8%.

To calculate this, use the steps below.

Work out the yearly interest: take the amount you’re claiming and multiply it by 0.08 (which is 8%).
