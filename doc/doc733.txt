You might be able to carry over any annual allowance you did not use from the previous 3 tax years.

When your annual allowance is lower than £60,000

Your annual allowance might be lower if you have:

flexibly accessed your pension pot

a high income

If you flexibly access your pension

Your annual allowance might be lower if you flexibly access your pension. For example, this could include taking:

cash or a short-term annuity from a flexi-access drawdown fund

cash from a pension pot (‘uncrystallised funds pension lump sums’)

The lower allowance is called the ‘money purchase annual allowance’.

If you have a high income

You’ll have a reduced (‘tapered’) annual allowance in the current tax year if both:

your ‘threshold income’ is over £200,000

your ‘adjusted income’ is over £260,000
