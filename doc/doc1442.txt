If you set up a voluntary arrangement, HMRC will send you 2 paper VAT Returns. These are for the following periods:

your current VAT period up to the day before the arrangement

the date of the arrangement up to the end of your next VAT period

After this, you can continue to use your online VAT account to send your VAT Returns.

You must send any VAT Returns that werenâ€™t done before you became insolvent to the HMRC VAT Controller. Your insolvency practitioner may do this for you.
