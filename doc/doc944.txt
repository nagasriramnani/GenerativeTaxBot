What your tax code means

Your tax code is made up of numbers and letters.

1257L is the tax code currently used for most people who have one job or pension.

HMRC will usually contact you to explain how they worked out your individual tax code if your tax code changes.

What the numbers mean

The numbers in your tax code tell your employer or pension provider how much tax-free income you get in that tax year.
