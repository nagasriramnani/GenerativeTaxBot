Their assets included a home worth £250,000, £15,000 in stocks and shares, £6,000 in cash and £4,000 in household and personal items. They gave away £10,000 above their tax free allowances in the 2 years before they died. The gross value of the estate = £285,000 (total value of assets plus gifts).

The debts of £20,000 included a mortgage for £15,000 and funeral costs of £5,000. The net value of the estate = £265,000 (the gross value minus debts of £20,000).

They left £1,000 to a registered charity. The net qualifying value of the estate = £264,000 (the net value minus exempt assets of £1,000 left to charity).

Once you have these 3 values, you can start to complete the probate form.
