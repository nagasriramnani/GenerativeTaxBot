Who can use it

You might want to use this scheme if you make a small proportion of sales at one VAT rate and the majority at another rate.

Your turnover, excluding VAT, can’t be more than £1 million a year.

There’s a separate scheme for businesses with a turnover of between £1 million and £130 million.

How to calculate your VAT

Calculate the expected selling prices (ESPs) for your minority or majority goods. Use the one that’s easier.

Total up the ESP for the VAT period.
