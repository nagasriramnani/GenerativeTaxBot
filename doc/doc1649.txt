Overview

Self Assessment is a system HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) uses to collect Income Tax.

Tax is usually deducted automatically from wages, pensions and savings. People and businesses with other income (including COVID-19 grants and support payments) must report it in a tax return.

If you need to send a Self Assessment tax return, fill it in after the end of the tax year (5 April) it applies to.

You must send a return if HMRC asks you to.

You may have to pay interest and a penalty if you do not file and pay on time.
