You’ll be told when and how the hearing will be held.

Your hearing may take place by phone, by video or in person. Read how to take part in a phone or video hearing.

You can watch a video about what happens at a video hearing.

If you or your witness or representative is outside the UK and wants to give live video or audio evidence, contact the tribunal to request it. Tell the tribunal what country you, the witness or representative is in and what type of evidence is being given. You must do this as soon as possible.
