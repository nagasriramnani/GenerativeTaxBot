VAT schemes

VAT schemes are designed to simplify the way some VAT-registered businesses calculate and account for VAT to HMRC.

They do not change the amount of VAT businesses charge for their products and services. They are voluntary to join.

VAT Flat Rate Scheme

The VAT Flat Rate Scheme lets you work out what you owe HMRC in VAT as a percentage of your gross turnover.

You can only use this scheme if you’re a small business with an annual taxable turnover of £150,000 or less excluding VAT.

The amount of VAT you pay depends on your industry and type of business.
