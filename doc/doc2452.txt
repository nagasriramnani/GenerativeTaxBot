Credit and conditional sales

A ‘credit sale’ means the sale of goods which immediately become the property of your customer but where the price is paid to you in instalments.

A ‘conditional sale’ is where you supply goods to a customer but the goods remain your property until they’re paid for.

The tax point for a credit sale or a conditional sale is created at the time you supply the goods or services to your customer. This is the basic tax point and is when you should account for the VAT on the full value of the goods.

This basic tax point may be over-ridden and an actual tax point created if you issue either a:

VAT invoice or receive payment before supplying the goods or services
