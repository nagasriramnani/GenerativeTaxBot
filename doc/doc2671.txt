VAT on energy-saving products

You’ll pay a rate of either 5% or 0% VAT when certain energy-saving products are installed in your home if you’re eligible.

Not all products or installations qualify for the lower rate and you cannot buy or install them yourself.

Your installer will be responsible for charging you the correct rate of VAT.
