For example:

If your reference year ends in September, and your liability is below the threshold at that point, your last payment on account will be in the following March. But you must carry on making payments on account until then.

We’ll tell you the effective date of your withdrawal from your payments on account arrangement.

If your total VAT liability within any completed year ending after your reference year falls below £1.8 million, you can ask the payments on account team in writing to remove you from the arrangement.

Give all the reasons why we should remove you from the arrangement.

If your business applies to cancel your VAT registration for any reason, contact the payments on account team to find out how your ‘payments on account’ arrangement will continue.
