your relationship ends - because you’ve divorced, ended (‘dissolved’) your civil partnership or legally separated

your income changes and you’re no longer eligible

you no longer want to claim

If your income changes and you’re not sure if you should still claim, call HMRC Marriage Allowance enquiries.

How to cancel

Either of you can cancel if your relationship has ended.

If you’re cancelling for another reason, the person who made the claim must cancel.
