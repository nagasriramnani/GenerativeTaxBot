Special rules for specific jobs

Some self-employed people do not pay National Insurance through Self Assessment, but may want to pay voluntary contributions. These are:

examiners, moderators, invigilators and people who set exam questions

people who run businesses involving land or property

ministers of religion who do not receive a salary or stipend

people who make investments for themselves or others - but not as a business and without getting a fee or commission
