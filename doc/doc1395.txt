£40,000

the same amount as the chargeable gain you made while letting out part of your home

Letting Relief does not cover any proportion of the chargeable gain you make while your home is empty.

Example
You rent out a large bedroom to a tenant. The bedroom amounts to 10% of your home.

You make a chargeable gain of £75,000 when you sell your home. As 10% of your house was let out, you only get private residence relief for £67,500 (90% of the total gain).

However, as the remaining gain of £7,500 relates to the bedroom that was rented out you’re also entitled to Letting Relief of £7,500.

This means you would pay no tax.

There are other rules that may affect the amount of Capital Gains Tax you need to pay.
