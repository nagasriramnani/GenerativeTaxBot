What you can do when a bailiff visits

A bailiff (‘enforcement agent’) may visit your home if you do not pay your debts - such as Council Tax bills, parking fines, court fines and county court, high court or family court judgments.

This will happen if you ignore letters saying that bailiffs will be used.

There are different kinds of bailiffs, known as:

‘certificated enforcement agents’ (also known as ‘civil enforcement agents’)

‘high court enforcement officers’

‘county court and family court bailiffs’
