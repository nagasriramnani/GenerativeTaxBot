How Inheritance Tax on a gift is paid

Any Inheritance Tax due on gifts is usually paid by the estate, unless you give away more than £325,000 in gifts in the 7 years before your death. Once you’ve given away more than £325,000, anyone who gets a gift from you in those 7 years will have to pay Inheritance Tax on their gift.

Example

Sally died on 1 July 2018. She was not married or in a civil partnership when she died.

She gave 3 gifts in the 9 years before her death:

£50,000 to her brother 9 years before her death

£325,000 to her sister 4 years and 2 months before her death

£100,000 to her friend 3 years before her death

There’s no Inheritance Tax to pay on the £50,000 gift to her brother as it was given more than 7 years before she died.
