When you don’t get tax relief for the final period

You don’t get any relief for the final period for any part of your home that you never lived in because you let it out or used it for business.

You only get some tax relief for the final period if the grounds, including all the buildings, were greater than 5,000 square metres (just over an acre) in total.

You can work out how much tax relief you get.
