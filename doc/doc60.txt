If your accounting period is more or less than 12 months

Adjust your AIA if your accounting period is more or less than 12 months.

For example

If your accounting period is 9 months the AIA will be 9/12 x £200,000 = £150,000.

You may also need to adjust the amount you claim if the AIA changed in that time.

The rules are different if your accounting period is longer than 18 months or you have a gap or overlap between accounting periods.

When you can claim

You can only claim AIA in the period you bought the item.

The date you bought it is:

when you signed the contract, if payment is due within less than 4 months

when payment’s due, if it’s due more than 4 months later
