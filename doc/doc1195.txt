bought the shares after 5 April 2013

been given the option to buy them at least 2 years before selling them

If the shares are not from an EMI

For at least 2 years before you sell your shares, the business must be a ‘personal company’. This means that you have at least 5% of both the:

shares

voting rights

You must also be entitled to at least 5% of either:

profits that are available for distribution and assets on winding up the company

disposal proceeds if the company is sold

If the number of shares you hold falls below 5% because the company has issued more shares, you may still be able to claim Business Asset Disposal Relief.
