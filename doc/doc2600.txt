The substitute can then apply along with any other executors.

If there’s no substitute but there are other executors who can apply, the other executors can apply straight away.

If there are no other executors and no substitute

Another ‘entitled’ person will need to apply. If the executor died, this is any beneficiary of the will who wants to apply.

If the executor has a mental health condition or impairment, one of the following can apply:

the executor’s court appointed deputy

someone with power of attorney for the executor, if there’s no deputy

a beneficiary of the will, if there’s no deputy or anyone with power of attorney

Get legal advice if you’re unsure who can apply.
