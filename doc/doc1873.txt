You may be able to use the HMRC tax checker to estimate how much tax you should have paid in the previous tax year.

If you do not understand your calculation, you can get advice from HMRC or a professional, for example a tax advisor or accountant.

Paying your tax bill

If the amounts are correct, you need to pay your Simple Assessment tax bill.

You must pay by either:

31 January - for any tax you owe from the previous tax year

within 3 months of the issue date, if you got your letter after 31 October

The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April.

If you cannot pay your tax bill in time

HMRC may suggest you pay what you owe in instalments.

If you think your tax calculation is wrong

If you think the amounts used in your calculation are wrong, call or write to HMRC within 60 days.
