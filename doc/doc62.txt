Items you also use outside your business

You cannot claim the full value of items you also use outside your business if you’re a sole trader or partnership. Reduce the capital allowances you claim by the amount you use the asset outside your business.

For example

You buy a laptop for £600. You use it outside your business for half of the time. The amount of capital allowances you can claim is reduced by 50%.

If you spend more than the AIA amount

Claim writing down allowances on any amount above the AIA. If a single item takes you above the AIA amount you can split the value between the types of allowance.

Mixed partnerships

AIA is only available for partnerships where all the members are individuals.
