Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs)

If you work for a company with assets of £30 million or less, it may be able to offer Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs).

Your company can grant you share options up to the value of £250,000 in a 3-year period.

You will not have to pay Income Tax or National Insurance if you buy the shares for at least the market value they had when you were granted the option.
