How much it costs

The court fee is £275.

Legal advisor fees vary depending on their experience and where you live. How much you pay in total depends on how many financial dispute resolution appointments you need and if there will be a final hearing.

You can get legal aid to help with court costs in certain situations, for example if you’re separating from an abusive partner.
