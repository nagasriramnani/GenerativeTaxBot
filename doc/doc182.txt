Work out your total taxable gain.

Use your basic rate band first against any gains eligible for Business Asset Disposal Relief. You’ll pay 10% tax on these.

Use any remaining basic rate band against your other gains. You’ll pay 18% on gains made on residential property and 10% on gains from all other chargeable assets.

For gains above the basic rate band you’ll pay 28% on gains made on residential property and 20% on gains from all other chargeable assets.

You can use your tax-free allowance against the gains that would be charged at the highest rates (for example where you would pay 28% tax).
