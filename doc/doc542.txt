The actual home does not have to end up in the hands of the direct descendants. An estate could still be eligible for the residence nil rate band if the estate’s personal representative sells the home as part of the administration of the estate and passes the sale proceeds to the direct descendants.

In the same way, once the direct descendants have inherited the home, there are no restrictions on what they can do with it. An estate will still qualify for the residence nil rate band, even if the direct descendants decide to sell the home after they’ve inherited it.

Example

A woman died in tax year 2019 to 2020 leaving her house worth £500,000 to her 3 grandchildren as part of the residue of her estate. The maximum available residence nil rate band in tax year 2019 to 2020 is £150,000.
