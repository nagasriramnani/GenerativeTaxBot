When bankruptcy ends

Get a person at risk of violence (PARV) order

When you’re made bankrupt, your name and address will be published in:

the Individual Insolvency Register

the London Gazette

If having your address published will put you at risk of violence, you can apply to the court for a person at risk of violence (PARV) order.

Your name will still be published, but your address will not be.

You can only apply for a PARV if you’ve already started a bankruptcy application.
