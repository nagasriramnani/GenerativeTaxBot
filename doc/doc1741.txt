You might be able to use a vehicle with foreign number plates for longer than 6 months if all of the following apply:

you normally live outside the UK

you’re in the UK for a set period as a student or worker

you claim relief from VAT and duty

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will give you a customs relief form when you claim relief – show it to police if you’re stopped when driving the vehicle.

If you stay after your customs relief expires you must register and tax your vehicle in the UK – follow the steps for importing a vehicle.

If you do not qualify for relief

If HMRC says your vehicle must be registered and taxed in the UK, contact the imports and exports helpline.

If you’re stopped by the police
