To value a joint bank account, divide the amount by the number of account holders, unless it’s in joint names for convenience only. For example, an older person may add their child to help them with the account. If so, use the amount the deceased actually owned instead.

Tenants in common

The rules are different for tenants in common as they do not automatically pass on any assets they jointly own.

If the deceased jointly owned property or land as a tenant in common, work out the value based on their share.

Working out the value of any gifts

You need to work out the value of any gifts made by the person who died.

Gifts only count towards the value of an estate if they were made in the 7 years before the person died and the total value of the gifts was over the £3,000 annual exemption.
