Interest in possession trusts

These are trusts where the trustee must pass on all trust income to the beneficiary as it arises (less any expenses).

Example

You create a trust for all the shares you owned.

The terms of the trust say that when you die, the income from those shares go to your wife for the rest of her life. When she dies, the shares will pass to your children.

Your wife is the income beneficiary and has an ‘interest in possession’ in the trust. She does not have a right to the shares themselves.

Discretionary trusts

These are where the trustees can make certain decisions about how to use the trust income, and sometimes the capital.

Depending on the trust deed, trustees can decide:

what gets paid out (income or capital)

which beneficiary to make payments to
