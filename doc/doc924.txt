have a county court or High Court judgment against you, which you cannot pay in full

Your responsibilities

You must keep up your repayments or the court can:

ask your employer to take money from your wages – known as an ‘attachment of earnings order’

cancel the arrangement

You may still be able to keep your business running, if you have one.

Public records

Your administration order is added to the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines.

It’s usually removed 6 years after the date the order was made.

Your entry is marked as ‘satisfied’ if you repay your debts in full.

You can also ask the court for a ‘certificate of satisfaction’. To do this, write to the court and send a cheque for £16 (made payable to His Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service).
