They also give credit where both the UK and another country impose tax on assets that are sited:

in a third country

both in the UK under UK law and in the other country under that country’s law

In these cases the credit is a proportion of the tax. The proportionate credit is computed by the formula:
A ÷ (A + B) x C

A is the Inheritance Tax, B is the overseas tax and C is whichever of A or B is smaller. 
If the UK and two or more other countries tax the same asset the above applies but with modifications.
