During the life of the trust there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay as long as the asset stays in the trust and remains the ‘interest’ of the beneficiary.

Between 22 March 2006 and 5 October 2008:

beneficiaries of an interest in possession trust could pass on their interest in possession to other beneficiaries, like their children

this was called making a ‘transitional serial interest’

there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay in this situation

From 5 October 2008:

beneficiaries of an interest in possession trust cannot pass their interest on as a transitional serial interest

if an interest is transferred after this date there may be a charge of 20% and a 10-yearly Inheritance Tax charge will be payable unless it’s a disabled trust
