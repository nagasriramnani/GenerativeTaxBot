If you’re owed more than £1,000 you’ll need to submit a  ‘Proof of Debt’ form.

If you’re owed £1,000 or less, you need to give the person handling your case your contact details and tell them how much you’re owed.

Who handles the case

Your case will usually be handled by a court official who deals with bankruptcies and liquidations, known as an ‘official receiver’.

They might hand the case over to an insolvency practitioner - a lawyer or accountant who specialises in debt recovery.

The official receiver or insolvency practitioner might also be called:

the ’trustee’ in a bankruptcy

the ‘liquidator’ in a company liquidation
