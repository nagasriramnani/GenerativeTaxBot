Your hearing can be held in the judge’s room or a courtroom in a county court if your claim is for less than £10,000. There might be a more formal hearing if you’re claiming for more.

After the hearing

You’ll get a decision on the day of the hearing. The court will also send you a copy of the decision by post.

If you win your case, the court will order the person or business who owes you money (the ‘debtor’) to pay you. There are ways the court can collect your payment if they ignore the court order.

Appeal the decision

You can appeal the decision if you think the judge made a mistake during the hearing. You must do this within 21 days of getting the decision.
