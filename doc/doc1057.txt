Fuel costs

There are different ways of reclaiming VAT on fuel, if you do not pay a fixed rate under the Flat Rate Scheme.

You can reclaim all the VAT on fuel if your vehicle is used only for business.

If you use the vehicle for both business and personal purposes, you can either:

reclaim all the VAT and pay the right fuel scale charge for your vehicle

only reclaim the VAT on fuel you use for business trips - youâ€™ll have to keep detailed mileage records

You might choose not to reclaim any VAT, for example if your business mileage is so low that the fuel scale charge would be higher than the VAT you can reclaim.

If you choose not to reclaim VAT on fuel for one vehicle you cannot reclaim VAT on any fuel for vehicles used by your business.
