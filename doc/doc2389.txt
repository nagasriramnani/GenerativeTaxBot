A financial order will describe how you’re going to divide up assets like:

pensions

property

savings

investments

It can also include arrangements for maintenance payments, including child maintenance.

When to apply for a financial order

You’ll usually need to wait until you have your conditional order or decree nisi before asking the court to make a financial order.

It is usually more straightforward to divide money and property before you apply for the final legal document to end the relationship.

The final legal document is the:

final order or decree absolute if you’re getting a divorce

final order if you’re ending a civil partnership
