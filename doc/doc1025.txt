You do not have to give full details of an estate’s value if all of the following are true:

the estate counts as an ‘excepted estate’

there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay

you’ve checked that none of the reasons under ‘when you need to send full details of the estate’s value even if no tax is due’ apply

Most estates are excepted estates.

What counts as an excepted estate depends on whether the person died:

on or after 1 January 2022

on or before 31 December 2021

If the person died on or after 1 January 2022

An estate is usually an excepted estate if any of the following apply:

its value is below the current Inheritance Tax threshold

the estate is worth £650,000 or less and any unused threshold is being transferred from a spouse or civil partner who died first
