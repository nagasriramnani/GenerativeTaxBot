Charities and VAT registration

As a charity, you must register for VAT with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if your VAT taxable turnover is more than £85,000.

You can choose to register if it’s below this, for example to reclaim VAT on your supplies.

If you’re registered for VAT you must send a return every 3 months.

Work out your taxable turnover

To work out your VAT taxable turnover add up the total value of everything you sell in a 12-month period that is not:

exempt from VAT

outside the scope of VAT
