transferred to a trust when they die

The availability of the residence nil rate band will depend on the type of trust.

This is because the type of trust will affect whether HMRC treats:

the home as part of a person’s estate for Inheritance Tax purposes

that person’s direct descendants as inheriting the home

How residence nil rate band tapers for estates over £2 million

The residence nil rate band will gradually reduce, or taper away, for an estate worth more than £2 million, even if a home is left to direct descendants.

The residence nil rate band will reduce by £1 for every £2 that the estate is worth more than the £2 million taper threshold.

Example

A man dies in the tax year 2018 to 2019 leaving an estate worth £2,100,000 to his children. This includes a home worth £450,000.
