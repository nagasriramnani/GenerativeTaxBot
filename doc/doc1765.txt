Read the guidance on completing your VAT Return.

If you’re registered for VAT in Northern Ireland, you must include EU sales on your VAT Return and complete an EC Sales List.

HMRC can charge you a penalty of up to 100% of any tax under-stated or over-claimed if you send an inaccurate return.

Accounting for import VAT

You can account for import VAT on your VAT Return by using ‘postponed VAT accounting’. This allows you to declare import VAT and reclaim it as a business expense on the same VAT Return.

Using estimated figures

Ask HMRC for permission to use estimated figures. You’ll need a good reason why you cannot give accurate figures on your VAT Return.
