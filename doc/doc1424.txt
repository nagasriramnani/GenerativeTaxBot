You’ll need proof you’re allowed to report on their behalf, such as a lasting power of attorney. If the person has died, you’ll need their date of death.

You cannot pay using your account if you’re reporting a gain on behalf of an estate as a personal representative (executor or administrator). HMRC will let you know how to pay after you report the gain.

Keep a digital or printed copy of the return for your records.

You cannot view or change a return that you’ve made for someone else online. Use a paper form for the 2022 to 2023 tax year and for the 2023 to 2024 tax year if you need to make a change.

For the tax years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 - or if you cannot access the internet - you’ll need to ask HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for a paper form.
