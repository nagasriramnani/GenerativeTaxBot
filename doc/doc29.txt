Report a suspicious HMRC phone call

Use the online form to tell HMRC if you’ve received a phone call you do not think is genuine. You’ll need to give your email address.

We may share your email address and phone number with other organisations to close down the scam.

Forward details of suspicious emails to HMRC’s phishing team

To help us deal with your email as quickly as possible, you should give details of what you’re reporting in the subject line (for example ‘Suspicious email address’).

HMRC will never send notifications of a tax rebate or ask you to disclose personal or payment information by email.
