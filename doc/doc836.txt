VAT visits and inspections

VAT officers can visit your business to inspect your VAT records (known as compliance checks) and make sure you’re paying or reclaiming the right amount of VAT.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) usually contact you to arrange a visit.

They normally give you 7 days’ notice. They’ll confirm what information they’ll want to see, how long it’s likely to take and if they want to inspect your premises. You can ask them to delay the visit.

HMRC can also visit without an appointment and telephone you about your VAT.

How often checks happen

How often you get a visit depends on:

how big or complex your business is

whether you’ve submitted late or incorrect VAT Returns before
