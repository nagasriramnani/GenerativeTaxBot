Your repayment will go direct to your bank account if HMRC has your bank details. Otherwise HMRC will send you a cheque (also known as a ‘payable order’). You can change the details that HMRC uses to make your repayment.

You can track a VAT repayment online.

Contact HMRC if you have not heard anything after 30 days. You may get compensation if HMRC takes longer than 30 days to approve your repayment.

The 30 days starts from the day HMRC receives your VAT Return and ends the day your repayment is approved, not the day you get it.

HMRC does not count days taken to check your return is accurate and legitimate, and to correct any errors or omissions, as part of this 30-day period.
