renting out property

capital gains, for example from selling property, valuable items or shares

working for yourself, including if you buy or sell items regularly, for example at car boot sales or on the internet (you’ll also need to register as self-employed)

If this income takes you over your Personal Allowance, you’ll pay tax on it.

Declare the income on a tax return

If you’re already registered for Self Assessment but have not declared all your income, you can make a change to your return.

If you do not usually send a tax return, you can register for Self Assessment to declare any income you have not paid tax on from the last 4 years. You’ll need to fill in a separate tax return for each year.
