Example
If you spent £60 and pay tax at a rate of 20% in that year, the tax relief you can claim is £12.

For some claims, you must keep records of what you’ve spent. You must claim within 4 years of the end of the tax year that you spent the money.

If your claim is for the current tax year, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will usually make any adjustments needed through your tax code.

If your claim is for previous tax years, HMRC will either make adjustments through your tax code or give you a tax refund.
