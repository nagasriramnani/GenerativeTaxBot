Building materials

You may claim a VAT refund for building materials that are part of the building and cannot be removed without tools or damaging the building.

What does not qualify

You cannot get a VAT refund for:

building projects in the Channel Islands

materials or services that do not have any VAT - for example, they were zero-rated or exempt

professional or supervisory fees - for example, architects or surveyors

hiring machinery or equipment

buildings for business purposes

buildings that cannot be sold or used separately from another property because of a planning permission condition

building materials that are not permanently attached to or part of the building itself
