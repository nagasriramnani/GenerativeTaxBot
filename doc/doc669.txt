Due dates for quarterly balancing payments

Your balancing payments are due with your VAT return and must clear our bank account by the last working day of the month if you’ve standard period end dates.

File your quarterly returns online as normal. But do not adjust any figures on your return to record payments on account that you’ve already made. Instead pay HMRC the net amount shown on your return less any payments on account you’ve already paid in that accounting period.

We’ll make any repayments that we owe you under the normal rules. If your return is a repayment return, we’ll repay the payments on account you’ve paid in the quarter.
