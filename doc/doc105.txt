Fees

You may have to pay a fee to apply for probate. Whether you need to pay depends on the value of the estate.

If the value of the estate is over £5,000, the application fee is £273.

There’s no fee if the estate is £5,000 or less.

You can order extra copies of the probate document for £1.50 each. This means you can send them to different organisations at the same time.
