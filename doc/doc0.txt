Contact an official receiver

An official receiver manages at least the first stage of bankruptcies and companies wound up by a court.

For example, they:

collect and protect assets for creditors after someoneâ€™s been made bankrupt

find out the reasons for the insolvency

act as trustee or liquidator where no private sector insolvency practitioner is appointed

Contact an official receiver by phone or email.

You cannot get debt advice from an official receiver. For free debt advice contact Citizens Advice or National Debtline.

In Scotland, contact an insolvency practitioner through the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland or the Insolvency Practitioners Association.
