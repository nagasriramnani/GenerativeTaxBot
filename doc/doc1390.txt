How your complaint will be dealt with

HMRC will arrange for your complaint to be reviewed by someone who has not been involved before. They will contact you if they need more information.

When HMRC have reviewed your complaint they will write to you with their response and a timescale to resolve it in.

Taking your complaint further

There is a right of appeal in certain cases that have been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.
