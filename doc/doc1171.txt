Appoint someone to deal with HMRC on your behalf

You can authorise someone else to deal with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for you, for example an accountant, friend or relative.

If you have to fill in a Self Assessment tax return, HMRC will send all correspondence to the person you’ve authorised - except tax bills or refunds. Otherwise, HMRC will continue to write to you.

If you just need someone to help you with your Self Assessment in the short term, call HMRC. The person who’s helping you must be with you when you call - HMRC will confirm their identity and check that you’re happy for them to represent you.

Authorise an agent to handle your tax affairs

A paid agent can be:

a professional accountant

tax adviser

They must meet HMRC’s standard for agents.
