Complain about HMRC

Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) as soon as possible if you have a complaint about their service.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

You can make a complaint if youâ€™re unhappy with the service provided, for example because:

you received a poor service

there were unreasonable delays

Follow a different process to:

disagree with a tax decision or a penalty

complain about serious misconduct by HMRC staff

You should continue to pay tax while your complaint is being dealt with. If you stop or delay your payments you may be charged interest or penalties.
