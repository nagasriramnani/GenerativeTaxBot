Inheritance Tax can also apply when you’re alive if you transfer some of your estate into a trust.

When Inheritance Tax is due

The main situations when Inheritance Tax is due are:

when assets are transferred into a trust

when a trust reaches a 10-year anniversary of when it was set up (there are 10-yearly Inheritance Tax charges)

when assets are transferred out of a trust (known as ‘exit charges’) or the trust ends

when someone dies and a trust is involved when sorting out their estate

What you pay Inheritance Tax on

You pay Inheritance Tax on ‘relevant property’ - assets like money, shares, houses or land. This includes the assets in most trusts.
