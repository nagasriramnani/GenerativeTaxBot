If you do not know how much to pay

You can make payments before you know the exact amount of Inheritance Tax owed by the deceased person’s estate. These are known as ‘payments on account’.

Check your payment has been received

HMRC do not send receipts for each payment you make. They’ll write to tell you when you’ve paid all the Inheritance Tax and interest you owe.

If you’ve paid through your own bank or building society, check your statement to confirm the payment has left your account.
