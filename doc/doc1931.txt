Help and advice

If you do not contact HMRC or refuse to pay

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will always try to contact you if you miss a tax payment. This can include sending you letters, texts and visiting you at home or at work.

If you do not get in contact with HMRC or cannot agree an instalment plan then HMRC may:

ask a debt collection agency to collect the money

collect what you owe directly from your wages or any monthly pension payments you get

take things you own and sell them (if you live in England, Wales or Northern Ireland)
