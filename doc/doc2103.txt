Non-UK resident trusts

The rules for Capital Gains Tax on non-UK resident trusts are complicated. You can get help with your tax.

Working out total gains

Trustees need to work out the total taxable gain to know if they have to pay Capital Gains Tax.

Allowable costs

Trustees can deduct costs to reduce gains, including:

the cost of the property (including any administration fees)

professional fees, for example for a solicitor or stockbroker

the cost of improving property or land to increase its value, for example building a conservatory (but not repairs or regular maintenance)

Tax reliefs

Trustees might be able to reduce or delay the amount of tax the trust pays if gains are eligible for tax relief.
