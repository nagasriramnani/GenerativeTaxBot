If you cannot sign the letter, you’ll need to contact the relevant department at HMRC or get someone to do it for you.

Give someone power of attorney over your tax affairs

You can give someone power of attorney over your tax affairs, such as by setting up a lasting power of attorney (LPA).

Depending on how you decide to set up the power of attorney, the person may be able to:

make tax decisions on your behalf

help you make tax decisions

If you’re ever unable to make decisions for yourself in the future but you have not given someone power of attorney, another person can set up a property and financial affairs deputyship instead. They will then be able to manage your tax affairs.

Tell HMRC about the power of attorney
