Treaties with France, Italy, India and Pakistan were in place before 1975 during the Estate Duty era and have different rules to eliminate double taxation.

If there is no double taxation agreement

If a transfer is liable to Inheritance Tax and also to a similar tax imposed by another country with which the UK does not have an agreement, you may be able to get relief under Unilateral Relief provisions.

Unilateral Relief

HMRC gives credit against Inheritance Tax for the tax charged by another country on assets sited in that country. For this purpose, UK law determines the location of the asset. If the tax that is charged on the asset by the other country exceeds Inheritance Tax on that asset, they limit the credit to the amount of Inheritance Tax.
