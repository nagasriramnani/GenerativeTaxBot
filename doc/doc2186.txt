Buying shares ‘off-market’

You must also pay SDRT on ‘off-market’ transactions. This is when shares are transferred outside CREST.

How to pay

Tax is not deducted automatically when you buy shares off-market.

You’ll need to send HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) a written notice with details of the transaction.

If you do not pay on time, you’ll be charged interest from the due date until the date you pay. You may also get a penalty.
