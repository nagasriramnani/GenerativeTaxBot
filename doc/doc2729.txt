After you apply

There are three stages:

the first appointment - a short hearing with the judge to discuss your application

financial dispute resolution (FDR) appointment -  to help you agree without needing a final hearing (you might need more than one appointment)

final hearing -  if youâ€™re not able to agree, this is when a judge will decide how you must separate your finances

The court will send you and your ex-partner details when the first appointment will be. This is usually 12 to 14 weeks after you apply.
