Temporary non-residents

Different rules apply if youâ€™re temporarily non-resident and make disposals during a tax year when you were either:

not resident in the UK

overseas as part of a split year

If you meet the temporary non-resident rules then the portion of gain not charged to non-resident Capital Gains Tax will come within the scope of UK Capital Gains Tax for the year, or period of return to the UK.

If you do not meet the temporary non-resident rules, there will not be an additional UK Capital Gains Tax charge for the earlier disposal when you return to the UK.
