Options if you're owed money

Use a mediation service, go to court, send a statutory demand or make someone bankrupt if a person or business owes you money.

Mediation

Mediation is when an impartial person - trained in dealing with difficult discussions between 2 opposing sides - acts like a referee in a dispute.

There can be a fee for mediation but it is cheaper than hiring a solicitor and taking court action. The fee is based on how much is owed.

You can find a mediation service to start the process. Use the Scottish Mediation Network if you’re in Scotland.

Court action

You can make a court claim for your money if mediation does not work.

The court can order the money to be paid.

Make an official demand for money you’re owed
