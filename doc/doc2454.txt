If you offer goods on credit to your customer and you do not involve a finance company, you’re financing the credit yourself. If you show the credit charge separately on the invoice you issue to your customer then it will be exempt from VAT . Other fees relating to the credit charge such as administration, documentation or acceptance fees will also be exempt. You declare VAT on the full value of the goods that you’ve supplied to your customer on the VAT Return for that period.

Additional fees relating to the goods, such as fees for transferring the ownership of the goods to the customer, are only exempt if the charge for them is £10 or less.
