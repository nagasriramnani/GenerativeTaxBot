You’ll need to specify which amounts you think are incorrect and what the amounts should be.

What happens next

If HMRC agrees that your Simple Assessment was wrong, you’ll be sent a new Simple Assessment letter.

If they disagree, you’ll get a decision letter explaining why, how to pay and how to appeal.

You’ll still need to pay your Simple Assessment tax bill by the deadline unless HMRC tells you they’ll delay your payment date.

How to appeal

If you disagree with HMRC’s response, you can make an appeal. Your decision letter will tell you how to do this.

You have 30 days from the date your decision letter was issued to appeal.
