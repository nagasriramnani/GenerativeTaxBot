You can use your tax-free allowance against the gains that would be charged at the highest rates (for example where you would pay 28% tax).

If you’re a trustee or business

Trustees or personal representatives of someone who’s died pay:

28% on residential property

20% on other chargeable assets

You’ll pay 10% if you’re a sole trader or partnership and your gains qualify for Business Asset Disposal Relief.
