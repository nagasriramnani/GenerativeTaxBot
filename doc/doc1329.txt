On bills and receipts

Sometimes VAT is shown on a separate line. This does not mean you’re paying extra - it just shows how much tax is included in the price.

Invoices from suppliers like builders, painters and decorators must show a separate amount for VAT and their VAT registration number.

How VAT is worked out

When someone charges you VAT they multiply their selling price by the VAT rate to calculate the amount of VAT to charge.

They then add this to the selling price to give you the price you actually pay - this is called the ‘gross’ price.
