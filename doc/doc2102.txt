If assets are taken out of a trust

The trustees usually have to pay the tax if they sell or transfer assets on behalf of the beneficiary.

There’s no tax to pay in bare trusts if the assets are transferred to the beneficiary.

Sometimes an asset might be transferred to someone else but Capital Gains Tax is not payable. This happens when someone dies and an ‘interest in possession’ ends.

A beneficiary gets some or all of the assets in a trust

Sometimes the beneficiary of a trust becomes ‘absolutely entitled’ and can tell the trustees what to do with the assets, for example when they reach a certain age.

In this case, the trustees pay Capital Gains Tax based on the assets’ market value when the beneficiary became entitled to them.
