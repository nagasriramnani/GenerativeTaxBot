Paying a bailiff

You can pay the bailiff on the doorstep - you do not have to let them into your home.

Make sure you get a receipt to prove you’ve paid.

If you cannot pay all the money right away, speak to the bailiff about how you could pay the money back.

Offer to pay what you can afford in weekly or monthly payments.

The bailiff does not have to accept your offer.
