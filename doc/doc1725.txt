Services received from overseas suppliers

When you buy services from suppliers in other countries, you may have to account for the VAT yourself – depending on the circumstances. This is called the ‘reverse charge’. Where it applies, you act as if you’re both the supplier and the customer. You charge yourself the VAT and then claim this back as input tax subject to the normal rules. In most cases the 2 amounts will be the same and cancel each other out.

When the reverse charge applies

The reverse charge on services only applies when the supplier is in a different country from you, you’re in business, belong in the UK and receive either:

one of the services that are covered by the general rule for place of supply of services

certain other services
