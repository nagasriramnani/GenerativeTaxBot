Work out if you need to pay

When you know your gain, you can work out if you need to report and pay Capital Gains Tax.

If you’ve used your possession for business, you can reduce or delay the tax you pay if you’re eligible for tax relief.

Reporting a loss

The rules are different if you need to report a loss.

You can claim losses for possessions sold for less than £6,000.  Work out your loss by using £6,000 as the amount you sold your possession for, and report it in your tax return.
