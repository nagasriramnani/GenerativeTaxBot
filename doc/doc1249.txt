Property

You do not pay Stamp Duty, Income Tax or Capital Gains Tax immediately if you inherit a property.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will contact you if you owe any Inheritance Tax.

The rules are different in Scotland.

Selling the property

You do not pay Capital Gains Tax when you sell your home. You will pay it if you make a profit when you sell a property that is not your main home.

If inheriting a property means you own 2 properties, you must tell HMRC which property is your main home within 2 years.
