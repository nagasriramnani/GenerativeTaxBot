Check when unused threshold may be transferred

The residence nil rate band may still be available under the downsizing rules if the surviving spouse or civil partner sold or gave away their home on or after 8 July 2015 and they leave other assets to their direct descendants when they die.

Couples who are not married or in a civil partnership, or whoâ€™ve divorced, will still be able to benefit from the residence nil rate band individually if they leave a home to their direct descendants. However, they will not be able to transfer any unused residence nil rate band to each other.
