If you do not want your employer to see your birth certificate or passport, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) can send you a letter to show them instead.

The letter will confirm:

you’ve reached State Pension age

you do not need to pay National Insurance

You’ll need to write to HMRC explaining why you do not want your employer to see your birth certificate or passport.

National Insurance contributions and Employers Office 
HM Revenue and Customs 
BX9 1AN

You’ll be asked to send your birth certificate or passport for verification if HMRC does not have a record of your date of birth. Certified copies are accepted.

You can also show a certificate of age exception (CA4140) if you have one.
