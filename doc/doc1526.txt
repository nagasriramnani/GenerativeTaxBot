Debts include things like utility bills, mortgages and money owed on credit cards. They also include funeral expenses, such as the cost of a funeral director, a headstone or plaque and refreshments.

You’ll then need to:

find out which organisations to contact (you can do this by searching through the deceased’s papers or asking friends, family and any solicitor or accountant they had)

write to these organisations asking for the value of the asset or debt when the person died (you’ll need to include a copy of the death certificate)

Which organisations to contact

Organisations that hold a person’s assets often include:

their bank

their pension provider - ask if you should include any private pension when you value the estate

their employer - the person may be owed wages
