Rates and pools

To claim writing down allowances, group items into pools depending on which rate they qualify for. You must work out how much you can claim separately for each pool.

The 3 types of pool are the:

main pool with a rate of 18%

special rate pool with a rate of 6%

single asset pools with a rate of 18% or 6% depending on the item

Main rate pool

You can claim 18% tax relief on all ‘plant and machinery’ you buy, unless the items need to go into:

the special rate pool

a single asset pool (for example, because you have chosen to treat them as ‘short life’ assets or you’ve used them outside your business)
