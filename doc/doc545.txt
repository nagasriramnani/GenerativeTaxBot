The maximum residence nil rate band in the tax year 2018 to 2019 is £125,000.

The estate is worth more than the taper threshold of £2 million by £100,000.

The residence nil rate band tapers away by £1 for each £2 that the estate is more than the taper threshold. So the residence nil rate band reduces by £50,000:

residence nil rate band

£125,000 (lower of £450,000 and £125,000)

less amount of taper

£50,000

net residence nil rate band for the estate

£75,000

If his estate was worth £2,250,000 or more, the residence nil rate band of £125,000 would taper away completely.

The value of the estate for taper purposes is the total of all the assets in the estate less any debts or liabilities. When you work out how much the estate is worth, do not take off any:
