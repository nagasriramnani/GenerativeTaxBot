If your tax code has a ‘K’ at the beginning

Tax codes with ‘K’ at the beginning mean you have income that is not being taxed another way and it’s worth more than your tax-free allowance.

For most people, this happens when you’re:

paying tax you owe from a previous year through your wages or pension

getting benefits you need to pay tax on - these can be state benefits or company benefits

Your employer or pension provider takes the tax due on the income that has not been taxed from your wages or pension - even if another organisation is paying the untaxed income to you.

Employers and pension providers cannot take more than half your pre-tax wages or pension when using a K tax code.
