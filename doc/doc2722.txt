How long SIPs valuations are valid for

SIP valuations can last up to 6 months but will end early if a significant event happens which is likely to impact the share value. You must re-apply to have your shares valued after a significant event.

You can also ask for the valuation period to end any time in the 6 months by contacting SAV.

After 6 months, you may apply to extend the valuation period by writing to SAV.

You’ll need to confirm in your letter that there have not been any significant events since the original valuation, and none are likely to happen in the period that you’re asking for the extension to cover.
