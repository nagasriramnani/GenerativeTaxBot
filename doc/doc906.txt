Register as a creditor in a bankruptcy or liquidation

Register as a creditor if a person or company owes you money and the court issues them with a bankruptcy or winding-up order.

When you register, you’ll be added to the list of creditors (people who are owed money). You’re not guaranteed any payment, but you’ll be:

kept informed about the case

allowed to vote on decisions at any creditors’ meetings

Creditor claims are different in Scotland - see the Accountant in Bankruptcy website.

How to register

Contact the person who’s handling the case and tell them you’re owed money.

You can find their details on either:

the Individual Insolvency Register if it’s an individual bankruptcy

the Companies House website if it’s a company liquidation
