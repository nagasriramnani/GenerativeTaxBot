Tax relief

You can get tax relief on private pension contributions worth up to 100% of your annual earnings.

You get the tax relief automatically if your:

employer takes workplace pension contributions out of your pay before deducting Income Tax

rate of Income Tax is 20% - your pension provider will claim it as tax relief and add it to your pension pot (‘relief at source’)

If your rate of Income Tax in Scotland is 19% your pension provider will claim tax relief for you at a rate of 20%. You do not need to pay the difference.

UK tax relief is also available on contributions made to certain types of overseas pension schemes.
