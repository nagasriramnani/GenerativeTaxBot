Relationship or family changes

Tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if:

you get married or form a civil partnership

you divorce, separate or stop living with your husband, wife or partner

You can tell HMRC online if you’re paid a salary or pension through PAYE. If you submit a Self Assessment tax return as well, your details will be updated for both.

You’ll need:

a Government Gateway user ID and password - if you do not have a Government Gateway user ID, you can create one when you tell HMRC online

a National Insurance number (a temporary reference number will not work).
