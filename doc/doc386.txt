Overview

You do not pay National Insurance after you reach State Pension age - unless you’re self-employed and pay Class 4 contributions. You stop paying Class 4 contributions at the end of the tax year in which you reach State Pension age.

You only pay Income Tax if your taxable income - including your private pension and State Pension - is more than your tax-free allowances (the amount of income you’re allowed before you pay tax).

You must contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you think you should be paying tax.
