Bare trusts

These are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the assets and income of the trust.

Transfers into a bare trust may also be exempt from Inheritance Tax, as long as the person making the transfer survives for 7 years after making the transfer.

Interest in possession trusts

These are trusts where the beneficiary is entitled to trust income as it’s produced - this is called their ‘interest in possession’.

On assets transferred into this type of trust before 22 March 2006, there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay.

On assets transferred on or after 22 March 2006, the 10-yearly Inheritance Tax charge may be due.
