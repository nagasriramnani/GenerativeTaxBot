Employee shareholder agreed valuations are valid for 60 days. You can award the shares for Employee Shareholder Status during this period.

If you have already awarded the shares, the valuation will apply for the date of the award only.

After 60 days, you may apply to extend the valuation period by writing to SAV, provided there have not been any significant events since the original valuation.

Significant events include (but are not limited to):

any change (completed or actively contemplated) in the share or loan capital of the company

any armâ€™s length transaction (completed or actively contemplated) involving shares of the company

negotiations or preparations for a flotation or takeover

any declaration of a dividend on any class of shares in the company
