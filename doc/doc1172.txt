They must meet HMRC’s standard for agents.

You must authorise your agent before they can deal with HMRC on your behalf. They will tell you how to do this.

If you’re an agent, find out how to get authorisation from a client.

A legal adviser or solicitor can also help with issues like Inheritance Tax and taxes on buying and selling property.

Authorise a friend or relative to manage your tax online

You can ask a friend or family member to register to manage your tax online - this is called having a ‘trusted helper’.

Your trusted helper can:

check you’re paying the right amount of Income Tax

check or update your personal tax account

claim a tax refund

check or update your company car tax

You’ll still be legally responsible for your own tax.
