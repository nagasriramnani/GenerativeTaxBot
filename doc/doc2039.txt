Homes that qualify

Only one home will qualify for the available residence nil rate band. If the person who died owned and lived in more than one home, the executor can choose which one to use.

The person that died must have owned and lived in the property at some time. A property that they owned but never lived in, such as a buy-to-let, will not qualify for this allowance.

You may be able to claim residence nil rate band by claiming a downsizing addition if the person who died either:

did not own a home because they sold or gave it away on or after 8 July 2015

downsized to a less valuable home thatâ€™s below the maximum threshold on or after 8 July 2015
