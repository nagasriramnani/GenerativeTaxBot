some of the estate is exempt from inheritance tax

As calculations of interaction can be very complex, you can ask a professional tax specialist to help.

Leaving a gift ‘free of tax’

Inheritance Tax must be paid on any gifts above the threshold that are not eligible for relief. The rate of Inheritance Tax is normally 40% but this reduces to 36% if you leave more than 10% of your estate to charity.

The value of an estate, tax thresholds and tax rates can change over time and can make the final amount of a gift uncertain. As a result you can choose to leave someone a specific amount ‘tax free’ instead, meaning the estate pays the tax.
