you could end up owing even more money

If you do let a bailiff in but do not pay them they may take some of your belongings. They could sell the items to pay debts and cover their fees.

You may be able to get extra time to make a payment or get debt advice if you’re a vulnerable person (for example, you have mental health problems or are seriously ill).

Check the bailiff’s identity

Before you let a bailiff in to take your things or pay them, ask to see:

proof of their identity, such as a badge, ID card or enforcement agent certificate

which company they’re from

a telephone contact number

a detailed breakdown of the amount owed
