Apply the residence nil rate band

Add the residence nil rate band to the basic Inheritance Tax threshold if the person and their estate meet the qualifying conditions.

This higher threshold does not mean that the home is exempt from Inheritance Tax but that can be the result in some cases.

Additional residence nil rate band may also be available from a late spouse or civil partner’s estate.
