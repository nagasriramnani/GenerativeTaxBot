Work out your gain

Youâ€™ll need to work out your gain to find out whether you need to pay Capital Gains Tax.

Your gain is usually the difference between what you paid for your shares and what you sold them for.

Market value

In some situations you should use the market value of the shares when working out your gain. Do this if:

you gave them away as a gift to someone other than your spouse, civil partner or a charity

you sold them for less than they were worth

you inherited them and do not know the Inheritance Tax value

you owned them before April 1982

you acquired them through certain Employee Share Schemes
