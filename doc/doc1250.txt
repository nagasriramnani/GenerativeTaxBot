If you do not tell HMRC which of your properties is your main home, HMRC will decide if a property was your main home when you sell it.

Renting out the property

You may have to pay tax on the rental income.

Properties held in trust

Usually if you inherit property held in a trust, you are the ‘beneficiary’ and the trustees are the legal owners and responsible for paying tax on income the trust receives.

You may still have to pay tax on any income you receive from the trust.

Bare trusts

If the trust is a ‘bare trust’ you are both the beneficiary and the legal owner and are responsible for paying tax on income the trust receives.
