UK tax on anything you earn above your Personal Allowance

National Insurance if you work for a UK employer

If you work for a foreign employer you do not need to pay National Insurance in the UK, but you might have to pay contributions in the country you’re working in.

If you’re self-employed

If you work for yourself you need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return each tax year, with details of your income and expenses. HMRC will then work out how much tax you need to pay.

Foreign students working in the UK

Some double-taxation agreements mean you do not pay UK tax on your income if you work while you’re a student.

If your country does not have an agreement like this, you have to pay tax in the same way as others who come to live in the UK.
