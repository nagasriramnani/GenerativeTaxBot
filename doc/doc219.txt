What you pay it on

You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you make a profit (‘gain’) when you sell (or ‘dispose of’) shares or other investments.

Shares and investments you may need to pay tax on include:

shares that are not in an ISA or PEP

units in a unit trust

certain bonds (not including Premium Bonds and Qualifying Corporate Bonds)

You’ll need to work out your gain to find out whether you need to pay tax. This will depend on if your total gains are above your Capital Gains Tax allowance for the tax year.
