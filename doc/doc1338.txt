Protect your lifetime allowance

The lifetime allowance was reduced in April 2016. You can apply to protect your lifetime allowance from this reduction.

If you hold lifetime allowance protection, this may increase the amount of tax-free lump sum you can take from your pensions.

Tell your pension provider the type of protection and the protection reference number when you decide to take money from your pension pot.
