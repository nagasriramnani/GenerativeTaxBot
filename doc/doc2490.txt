Apply for help online

Apply for help with fees online before you make a court claim. You’ll get a ‘help with fees’ reference number - you’ll need this when you make your court claim.

Apply for help by post

If you apply for help with fees by post, you’ll need to make your court claim by post too. Apply for both at the same time.

Fill in form EX160 for help with fees.

Fill in form N1 to make a court claim for money.
