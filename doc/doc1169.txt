Example 
You owned your home for 20 years and were away for 5 (25% of the time). The time you lived away was not during the last 9 months or another period that qualified for relief. The amount of gain you get relief on is reduced by 25%.

There are other rules that affect tax relief when you sell your home.

If youâ€™re not sure how the rules apply to you, call the Capital Gains Tax helpline.
