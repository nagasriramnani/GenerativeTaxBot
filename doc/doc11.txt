when they send their Self Assessment tax return

If your new Personal Allowance is lower than your income after you’ve made a claim, you might have to pay some income tax. However, you might still benefit as a couple.

How your tax code will change

You and your partner will get new tax codes that reflect the transferred allowance. Your tax code will end with:

‘M’ if you are receiving the allowance

‘N’ if you are transferring the allowance

Your tax code will also change if you’re employed or get a pension.
