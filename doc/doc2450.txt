If the payments are going to be made regularly you can issue a VAT invoice at the beginning of any period of up to a year for all the payments due in that period, as long as there’s more than 1 payment due. For each payment you should set out on the invoice the:

amount of the payment excluding VAT

date the payment’s due

rate of VAT

amount of VAT payable

If you decide to issue an invoice at the start of a period, you do not have to account for VAT on any payment until either the date the payment’s due or the date you receive it, whichever happens first.

The same procedures apply to continuous supplies of goods, in the form of water, gas and electricity.
