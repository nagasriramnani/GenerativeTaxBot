You can ask for your complaint to be reviewed a second time. This is called a ‘second tier’ review. HMRC will tell you how to do this.

A different person will review your complaint and tell you the outcome.

If you disagree with the outcome of the second tier review

You can ask the Adjudicator’s Office to review your complaint. HMRC will tell you how to do this.

This service is free and independent of HMRC.

You can only ask the Adjudicator’s Office to look at your complaint if you’ve had a first and second tier review from HMRC.

If you disagree with the Adjudicator’s Office

You can ask your Member of Parliament to refer your complaint to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.
