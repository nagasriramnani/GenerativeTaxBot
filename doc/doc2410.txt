When you don’t get full relief

You may still owe some tax if you qualify for tax relief for a tax year, but in that year one or more of the following applies:

you let part of your home out - this doesn’t include having a lodger

you used part of it for business only

the grounds of your home, including all buildings, were greater than 5,000 square metres (just over an acre) in total

You get full tax relief for the last 9 months you own your home if you qualify for tax relief for any period. This is called ‘the final period’.

If you’re disabled or in long-term residential care the final period is 36 months.

There are some exceptions when you don’t get full tax relief for the final period.
