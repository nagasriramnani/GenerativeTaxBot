You must attend a meeting about mediation before you can apply to the court to decide - except in certain cases (if there’s been domestic abuse, for example).

A financial order will describe how you’re going to divide up assets like:

pensions

property

savings

investments

It can also include arrangements for maintenance payments, including child maintenance.

When to apply for a financial order

You’ll usually need to wait until you have your conditional order or decree nisi before asking the court to make a financial order.

It is usually more straightforward to divide money and property before you apply for the final legal document to end the relationship.
