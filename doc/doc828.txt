Enforce a judgment

You can ask the court to collect payment from the person or business who owes you money (the ‘debtor’) if they do not pay you after receiving the court order.

You must pay a court fee when you ask the court to collect the payment.

Find out what the debtor can afford to pay

Ask the court to order the debtor to attend court to provide evidence of their income or spending, for example bills and statements.

If the money is owed by a business, you can ask for an officer from the company to attend court and give details of its accounts.
