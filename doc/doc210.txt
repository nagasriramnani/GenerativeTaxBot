How to import a vehicle

You must complete certain steps as soon as you bring a vehicle into the UK permanently.

You can pay an importer or shipping company to do them for you.

Tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) within 14 days that the vehicle has arrived in the UK.

Pay VAT and duty if HMRC tells you to.

Get vehicle approval to show your vehicle meets safety and environmental standards.

Register and tax the vehicle with DVLA - theyâ€™ll give you a registration number so you can get number plates made up.
