final hearing -  if you’re not able to agree, this is when a judge will decide how you must separate your finances

The court will send you and your ex-partner details when the first appointment will be. This is usually 12 to 14 weeks after you apply.

Before the first appointment

You and your ex-partner need to fill in a financial statement for a financial order (Form E) to show a breakdown of your property and debts. This includes giving an estimate of your future living costs.

You’ll also need to collect documents about your finances, for example:

rental or mortgage agreements

pension documents

loan agreements

proof of your salary income, for example P60 or recent pay slips

details of personal belongings worth more than £500, for example a car or house contents
