If an item qualifies for more than one capital allowance, you can choose which one to use.

Work out the value of your item

In most cases, the value is what you paid for the item. Use the market value (the amount you’d expect to sell it for) instead if:

you owned it before you started using it in your business

it was a gift

Other business costs

You claim for the cost of things that are not business assets in a different way. This includes:

your business’s day-to-day running costs

items that it’s your trade to buy and sell

interest payments or finance costs for buying assets

Claim these costs as business expenses if you’re a sole trader or partnership, or deduct from your profits as a business cost if you’re a limited company.
