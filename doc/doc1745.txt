Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA)

Motorcycle Single Vehicle Approval (MSVA) if it’s a 2, 3 or smaller 4-wheeled vehicle

If the vehicle’s registered in the EU

Get a European Certificate of Conformity from the manufacturer to show you have approval for an EU-registered vehicle.

If it’s a left-hand drive vehicle, you’ll also need a certificate of GB conversion Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA).

If you have a lorry or goods vehicle over 3,500kg, you cannot get a certificate of GB conversion IVA. Apply for IVA instead.
