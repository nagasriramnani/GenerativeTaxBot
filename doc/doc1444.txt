how much tax relief you get

If the tax rates in the 2 countries are different, you’ll pay the higher rate of tax. The tax year may start on different days in different countries.

Double taxation agreements do not apply to tax on gains from selling UK residential property.

What income you can claim for

You can claim for income including:

most pensions - most UK government (such as civil service) pensions are only taxed in the UK

wages and other pay (including self-employment)

bank interest

dividends - special rules apply, which HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) explain in section 10 of ‘Residence, Domicile and the Remittance Basis’
