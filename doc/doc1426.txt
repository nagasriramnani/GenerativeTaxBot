View and change a previous return

You can use your Capital Gains Tax on UK property account to view and change your own previous returns.

Use a paper form if you need to change a return you made for someone else for the 2022 to 2023 tax year and for the 2023 to 2024 tax year.

For the tax years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 - or if you cannot access the internet - youâ€™ll need to ask HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for a paper form.
