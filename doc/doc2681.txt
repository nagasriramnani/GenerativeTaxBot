Conversions

The building being converted must usually be a non-residential building. Residential buildings qualify if they have not been lived in for at least 10 years.

You may claim a refund for builders’ work on a conversion of a non-residential building into a home.

For other conversions builders can charge a reduced VAT rate.

Communal and charity buildings

You may get a VAT refund if the building is for one of the following purposes:

non-business - you cannot charge a fee for the use of the building

charitable, for example a hospice

residential, for example a children’s home
