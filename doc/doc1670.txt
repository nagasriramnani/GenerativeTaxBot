Inheriting Additional State Pension

If you get divorced

Overview

The Additional State Pension is an extra amount of money you could get on top of your basic State Pension if you’re:

a man born before 6 April 1951

a woman born before 6 April 1953

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

You get the new State Pension if you were born on or after this date. You will not qualify for the Additional State Pension, but you might still be able to inherit Additional State Pension from your partner.

You get the Additional State Pension automatically if you’re eligible for it, unless you’ve contracted out of it.
