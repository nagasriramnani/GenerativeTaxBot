If you work in the UK and abroad

There are special rules if you work both in the UK and abroad.

You do not have to pay tax on foreign income or gains (even those you bring into the UK) if you get the ‘foreign workers’ exemption’.

You qualify if:

your income from your overseas job is less than £10,000

your other foreign income (such as bank interest) is less than £100

all your foreign income has been subject to foreign tax (even if you did not have to pay, for example because of a tax-free allowance)

your combined UK and foreign income is within the band for basic rate Income Tax

you do not need to fill in a tax return for any other reason

If you qualify, you do not need to do anything to claim.
