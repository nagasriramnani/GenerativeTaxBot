After you register

You’ll get your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) by post in 10 working days (21 days if you’re abroad). You’ll get it sooner in your personal tax account or HMRC app.

You can find a UTR number if you’ve lost it.

If you registered online

Sign in to your personal tax account to activate your Self Assessment. You’ll need your UTR number.

If you sent the form by post

Create your personal tax account and sign up for Self Assessment.

You’ll get an activation code for your new account in the post within 7 working days (21 if you’re abroad). When you get the code, sign in to activate your Self Assessment.

You can replace an activation code if you do not receive it or you lose it.

If you’ve filed online before

Sign in to your existing account.
