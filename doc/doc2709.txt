Help friends or family with their tax

Register online as a ‘trusted helper’ to help a friend or relative:

check they’re paying the right amount of Income Tax

check or update their personal tax account

check or update their taxable benefits (company cars or medical insurance only)

The person you’re helping must then use the service to accept your registration. If they cannot go online, you may be able to call HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on their behalf.

You can be a trusted helper for up to 5 people.

The person you’re helping will still be legally responsible for their own tax.
