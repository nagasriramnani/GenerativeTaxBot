you’re using a secure registration scheme

If your customer changes their mind about how to use the vehicle and you can no longer use a secure registration scheme you must use NOVA instead within 14 days of your customer letting you know.

Log in to use the NOVA service.

You’ll need a Government Gateway user ID and password. If you do not have a user ID, you can create one when you log in.

If you’re bringing lots of vehicles into the UK, you can attach a spreadsheet that lists all the vehicles when you use the NOVA service.

What happens next

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will confirm the VAT due when they’ve processed your NOVA form.

Pay VAT through customs on vehicles you import from:

outside the UK to Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland)

outside the EU to Northern Ireland
