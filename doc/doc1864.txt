If there’s a balance left in your pool, you can claim writing down allowances on it.

If you originally used writing down allowances

If you used writing down allowances when you bought an item, deduct the value from the pool you originally added it to.

Use the amount that’s left to work out your next writing down allowances.

For items in single asset pools, claim any amount that’s left as a capital allowance. Do this in your tax return. The leftover amount is known as a ‘balancing allowance’.

If the value you deduct is more than the balance in the pool, add the difference to your profit. This is a balancing charge.

You can only get a balancing allowance in your main or special rate pool when you close your business. You can get a balancing charge in any pool in any year.
