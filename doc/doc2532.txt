Overview

You may get a county court judgment (CCJ) or high court judgment if someone takes court action against you (saying you owe them money) and you do not respond.

You must respond to the court claim by the date on the email or letter you receive.

If you get a judgment, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money.

The judgment will come in the post and will explain:

how much you owe

how to pay (in full or in instalments)

the deadline for paying

who to pay
