You must claim a refund from HMRC within 4 years and 6 months of the date the payment was due or the date of supply (whichever was later).

For each bad debt you must show:

total amount of VAT involved

amount written off and any payments you’ve received

the VAT you’re claiming on the debt

the VAT period(s) you paid the VAT and are claiming the relief

invoice details like the date and the customer’s name

You must keep this information for 4 years after the claim is made, or 10 years if you used the VAT MOSS.

Time of supply or tax point

You need to know a transaction’s time of supply (or ‘tax point’). This is the date the transaction takes place for tax purposes.

The tax point tells you which VAT period the transaction belongs to, and which return to put it on.
