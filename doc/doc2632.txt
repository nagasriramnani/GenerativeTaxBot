There are some occasions where you may not have to pay Inheritance Tax - for example where the trust contains excluded property.

Special rules

Some types of trust are treated differently for Inheritance Tax purposes.

Bare trusts

These are where the assets in a trust are held in the name of a trustee but go directly to the beneficiary, who has a right to both the assets and income of the trust.

Transfers into a bare trust may also be exempt from Inheritance Tax, as long as the person making the transfer survives for 7 years after making the transfer.
