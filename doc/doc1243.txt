Using a paper form

For the main Self Assessment tax return, call HMRC and request form SA100. You can download all other forms and supplementary pages.

The deadline for sending a return using a paper form is 31 October (or 31 January if you’re a trustee of a registered pension scheme or a non-resident company).

If you’re sending a tax return for the 2018 to 2019 tax year or earlier, get forms from the National Archives.
