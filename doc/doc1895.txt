The residence nil rate band and any transferred residence allowance is available if the surviving spouse or civil partner:

leaves a home to their direct descendants

includes the home in their estate

Homes that qualify

The home that the surviving spouse or civil partner leaves to their direct descendants does not have to be the same home that they lived in with their partner to either qualify for the residence nil rate band or to transfer it.

They do not have to have previously owned the home with their late partner, or inherited it from them. It can be any home as long as both these conditions are met:

the surviving spouse or civil partner lived in it at some stage before they died

the home is included in their estate.

Check when unused threshold may be transferred
