If youâ€™ve more than one place of supply

If you have a business establishment in the UK and establishments in other countries, you must look at what each establishment does in terms of supplying services. If, for example, your company has its head office in the UK, but has a French subsidiary that supplies services to local businesses, then the French company belongs in France for VAT purposes. This is the case even if your head office belongs in the UK for supplies that it makes in the UK.

Special rules for the place of supply

In some cases, the place of supply is determined by what service is supplied, rather than where the supplier or the customer belongs.
