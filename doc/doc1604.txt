VAT repayments

Usually, if you’ve charged your customers less VAT than you’ve paid on your purchases, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) repay you the difference.

When you complete the boxes on your VAT Return, the information you enter will show you the:

total amount of VAT charged - Box 3

total amount of VAT paid - Box 4

You’re due a repayment if the figure in Box 3 is less than the figure in Box 4.

How much you’re repaid is the figure shown in Box 5 of your VAT Return.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

How long it takes

Repayments are usually made within 30 days of HMRC getting your VAT Return.
