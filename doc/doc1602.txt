What you need to do

How you report and pay your Capital Gains Tax depends whether you sold:

a residential property in the UK on or after 6 April 2020

something else that’s increased in value

Before you can report any gains you’ll need:

details of how much you bought and sold the asset for

the dates when you took ownership and disposed of the asset

any other relevant details, such as the costs of buying, selling or making improvements to the asset and any tax reliefs you’re entitled to

calculations for each capital gain or loss you report
