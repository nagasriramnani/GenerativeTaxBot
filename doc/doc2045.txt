Overview

You need to keep records if you have to send HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) a Self Assessment tax return.

You’ll need your records to fill in your tax return correctly. If HMRC checks your tax return, they may ask for the documents.

You must also keep records for business income and outgoings if you’re self-employed.

How to keep your records

There are no rules on how you must keep records. You can keep them on paper, digitally or as part of a software program (like book-keeping software).
