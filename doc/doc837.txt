During the visit

HMRC will work with you to put right any problems with your VAT. They’ll also tell you about any additional tax and penalty you have to pay.

Helping them with the check will reduce the amount of any penalty.

After the visit

Afterwards, HMRC will write to you confirming:

what you must do to improve your VAT record keeping

any corrections you must make to your VAT account

if you’re overpaying or underpaying your VAT

any penalty you have to pay

You can appeal an HMRC decision but you must do it within 30 days.
