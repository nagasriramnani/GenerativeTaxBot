The interaction rules

Apply interaction rules if the estate qualifies for Agricultural or Business Relief and the will also has:

at least one specific gift of property

property subject to tax relief that’s not specifically given as a gift

some of the estate is exempt from inheritance tax

As calculations of interaction can be very complex, you can ask a professional tax specialist to help.

Leaving a gift ‘free of tax’

Inheritance Tax must be paid on any gifts above the threshold that are not eligible for relief. The rate of Inheritance Tax is normally 40% but this reduces to 36% if you leave more than 10% of your estate to charity.
