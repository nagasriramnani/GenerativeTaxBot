Giving gifts you still benefit from

If you give something away but still benefit from it (a ‘gift with reservation’), it will count towards the value of your estate.

Gifts with reservation include:

giving your home to a relative but still living there

giving away a caravan but still using it for free for your holidays

giving away a valuable painting but still displaying it in your house

what you gave and who you gave it to

the value of the gift

when you gave it
