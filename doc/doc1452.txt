How much you'll pay

The amount you’ll be asked to pay each month will be based on how much you have left after you pay any rent, food or utility bills and fixed outgoings you have, like subscriptions.

You’ll usually be asked to pay around half of what you have left over each month towards the tax you owe.

You can also agree to pay more if you want. Paying your debt quicker means you’ll pay less in total because you’ll pay less interest.

If you get a pension, HMRC will count that as income, but will not count the amount in your pension pot as savings.
