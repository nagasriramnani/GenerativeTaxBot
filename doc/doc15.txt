What trustees do

The trustees are the legal owners of the assets held in a trust. Their role is to:

deal with the assets according to the settlor’s wishes, as set out in the trust deed or their will

manage the trust on a day-to-day basis and pay any tax due

decide how to invest or use the trust’s assets

If the trustees change, the trust can still continue, but there always has to be at least one trustee.

Beneficiaries

There might be more than one beneficiary, like a whole family or defined group of people. They may benefit from:

the income of a trust only, for example from renting out a house held in a trust

the capital only, for example getting shares held in a trust when they reach a certain age

both the income and capital of the trust
