But his estate is worth more than the taper threshold of £2 million by £100,000.

The residence nil rate band available to his estate tapers by £1 for each £2 over the taper threshold. So the residence nil rate band reduces by £50,000.

If he had left his home to his children, the residence nil rate band would have been £75,000 (£125,000 less £50,000). So the amount of his unused residence nil rate band is £75,000.

The percentage of unused residence nil rate band in his estate is:

unused residence nil rate band

£75,000

divided by maximum residence nil rate band in the tax year 2018 to 2019

÷ £125,000

percentage of unused residence nil rate band

60%

The man’s wife dies in tax year 2020 to 2021, when the maximum residence nil rate band is £175,000.
