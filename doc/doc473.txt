If you’re a higher rate taxpayer

You’ll have to pay extra tax on the difference between what tax the trustees have paid and what you, as a higher rate taxpayer, are liable for. This will be calculated when you do your Self Assessment.

How to reclaim tax

You can reclaim tax paid on:

dividends (if you’re entitled to dividend allowance)

savings interest (if you’re entitled to personal savings allowance)

trade and property income (if you’re entitled to trading allowance or property allowance)

The allowance amount will be reduced if it’s already been used against some income. The allowance you have left is called the ‘available allowance’.

If the amount of income you receive is less than or equal to the available allowance, you can reclaim all of the tax paid.
