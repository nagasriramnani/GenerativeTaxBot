provide a certificate of service to the court confirming that the petition has been served on the company

You can get a ‘process server’ to help you - your solicitor can arrange this.

You can serve the petition by attaching it to the company’s front door or leaving it at the office if you cannot serve it in person.

The day after you serve the petition, send a copy to the relevant liquidator, administrative receiver, administrator or supervisor if the company is involved in:

voluntary liquidation

administrative receivership

an administration order

a voluntary arrangement
