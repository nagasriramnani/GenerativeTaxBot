What's tax-free

You won’t usually pay any tax if your total annual income adds up to less than your Personal Allowance.

Lump sums from your pension

You can usually take up to 25% of the amount built up in any pension as a tax-free lump sum. This is limited to a maximum of 25% of your available lifetime allowance. For most individuals, the standard lifetime allowance applies. This is currently £1,073,100.

If you hold lifetime allowance protection, this may increase the amount of tax-free lump sum you can take from your pensions.

The tax-free lump sum doesn’t affect your Personal Allowance.
