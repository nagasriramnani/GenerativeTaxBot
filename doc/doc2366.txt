When you can claim back VAT

If you had to charge VAT on items you paid for because they were supplied to you and not to your client, you can claim back any VAT you paid on them. It makes no difference whether or not you passed these costs on to your customers as recharges. You’ll need a VAT invoice for each item you claim the VAT back on.
