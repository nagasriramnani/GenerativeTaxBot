If you need to file a tax return, you’ll get a reminder letter or email telling you to complete one before it’s due.

Register online using form CWF1 for Self Assessment and Class 2 National Insurance.

You’ll need your 10-digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) from when you registered before. You can find your UTR if you do not know it.

If you cannot register using the online service

Register for Self Assessment and Class 2 National Insurance by filling in the form online. Print and post it to HMRC.

You’ll need to have all your information ready as you cannot save a partly completed form.

After you’ve registered, you’ll receive a letter with your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) number within 10 working days (21 if you’re abroad).
