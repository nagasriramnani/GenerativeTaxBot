Rules for self-billing

You can set up self-billing arrangements with your suppliers as long as you can meet certain conditions, you’ll need to:

enter into an agreement with each supplier

review agreements with suppliers at regular intervals

keep records of each of the suppliers who let you self-bill them

make sure invoices contain the right information and are correctly issued

Your suppliers do not have to be based just in the UK. You can self-bill businesses in other countries.

You must not issue self-billed invoices to a supplier who has changed their VAT registration number until you’ve prepared a new self-billing agreement for them.
