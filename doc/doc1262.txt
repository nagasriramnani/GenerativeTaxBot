a penalty worth up to double the tax you owe

You can be prosecuted if you give false information about the tax you owe. If you tell HMRC as soon as you can, they may consider your case more favourably.

You may be eligible to tell HMRC about undeclared income through an ‘offshore disclosure facility’ if:

you have not told them about your foreign income

you’re not paying the right amount of tax

you’ve previously made an incorrect claim

you’re behind with your tax

If you’re not eligible to use an offshore disclosure facility, but still have tax to declare, contact HMRC’s Offshore Co-ordination Unit.
