Stop paying National Insurance

You pay National Insurance contributions to qualify for certain benefits including the State Pension.

If you’re employed, you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions as a percentage of your earnings up to State Pension age.

If you’re self-employed, you pay Class 2 contributions at a flat weekly rate and Class 4 contributions annually as a percentage of your taxable profits.

What happens at State Pension age

You stop paying Class 1 and Class 2 contributions when you reach State Pension age - even if you’re still working.
