Accounting for VAT while you wait for your VAT number

You cannot include VAT on your invoices until you get your VAT number but you can increase your prices to account for the VAT you’ll need to pay to HMRC.

Example

On 1 May, you arrange a £100,000 contract to provide services to a new customer. You register for VAT because you know you’ll go over the threshold in the next 30 days.

Your effective date of registration is 1 May. This means you’ll need to pay VAT to HMRC on any invoices you raise from that date.

To account for the VAT you’ll need to pay, tell your customer that you’ll be adding 20% to the original contract amount of £100,000 and then raise an invoice for £120,000.
