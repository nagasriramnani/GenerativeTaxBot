If your circumstances change

You’ll lose the right to pay the reduced rate if:

you get divorced

you have not earned over the Lower Earnings Limit (currently £123 a week), or been self-employed, for 2 tax years in a row

If your husband dies, you may be able to keep your right for a certain time. Contact HMRC for more information.

Tell your employer or HMRC if you lose the right to pay the reduced rate. You might owe HMRC unpaid National Insurance if you do not.
