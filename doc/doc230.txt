What you pay it on

You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you make a profit (‘gain’) when you sell (or ‘dispose of’) property that’s not your home, for example:

buy-to-let properties

business premises

land

inherited property

There are different rules if you:

sell your home

live abroad

are a company registered abroad

You’ll need to work out your gain to find out whether you need to pay tax.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

When you do not pay

You do not usually need to pay tax on gifts to your husband, wife, civil partner or a charity.

You may get tax relief if the property is a business asset.
