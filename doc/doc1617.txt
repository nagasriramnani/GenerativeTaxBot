Exempt from VAT

You cannot charge VAT on exempt goods and services (such as the provision of welfare services). You cannot normally reclaim VAT on any goods and services purchased in relation to an exempt business activity.

You cannot register for VAT if all your business activities are exempt from VAT.

Outside the scope of VAT

Income from non-business activities is ‘outside the scope’ of VAT (you cannot charge or reclaim VAT on them). This includes:

donations where nothing is given in return

grant funding given to support your charitable activities where nothing is given in return

activities where your organisation does not make a charge
