Late returns and payment

If you miss the deadline for submitting your return, HMRC will send you a ‘VAT notice of assessment of tax’ telling you how much VAT they think you owe.

You may need to pay a surcharge or penalty for submitting your return after the deadline or paying it late.

The amount you owe will be worked out differently, depending on which accounting period it’s for.
