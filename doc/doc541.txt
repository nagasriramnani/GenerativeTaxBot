For example, if the will has a condition that the grandchildren have to reach a certain age before they can inherit the home, the property is held in a trust, so the residence nil rate band will not apply. This is because the grandchildren do not inherit the home at the time that their grandparent dies.

If the home is held in a trust before a person dies and it stays in trust when they die, the home will only qualify for the residence nil rate band if it becomes part of the direct descendantâ€™s estate after the person dies.
