How long to keep your records

You must keep records about your business income and costs for longer if you’re self-employed.

How long you should keep your records depends on whether you send your tax return before or after the deadline.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) may check your records to make sure you’re paying the right amount of tax.

Tax returns sent on or before the deadline

You should keep your records for at least 22 months after the end of the tax year the tax return is for.
