If there’s a will

You can apply for probate if you’re named as an executor in either the will or an update to it (known as a ‘codicil’).

The person who died will normally have told you if you’re an executor.

You’ll only inherit assets (for example, money or property) if you’re also named as a beneficiary in the will.

Before you apply for probate, you need to estimate the value of the estate of the person who died. You’ll need this estimate when you apply.
