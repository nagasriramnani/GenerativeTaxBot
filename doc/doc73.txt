You can transfer your credits that you got from registering for Child Benefit to your spouse or partner who is living with you if you have paid a year’s National Insurance contributions (called a ‘qualifying year’ for State Pension).

Check your credits

Check your National Insurance record to find out if you have credits. If you applied for credits but they’re wrong on your record, contact the office where you applied.

Call the helpline if you have questions about National Insurance credits.
