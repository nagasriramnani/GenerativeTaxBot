Work out the value of the estate

To get the value of the estate on which Inheritance Tax is due use these steps:

Work out the market value of all the assets in the estate. Add these up to get the ‘gross value’ of the estate.

Take off any debts (for example, a mortgage). This gives you the ‘net value of the estate’.
