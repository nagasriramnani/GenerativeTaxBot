Energy saving and mobility aids

You may be able to charge the reduced rate of VAT (5%) for work in residential properties to install:

certain energy-saving, heating and security products

mobility aids for people over 60

This includes the cost of the products themselves if you install them - but if you only supply them you must charge the standard rate of 20%.
