When you can object

You can object to a limited company being struck off the Companies Register if:

you are a shareholder or other interested party, such as a creditor

you have a reason to stop the company being removed from the register - for example, you have a legal claim against them or they owe you money

You can only object after notice that the company is going to be struck off has been published in The Gazette.

You must have evidence to support your objection - for example, invoices or other evidence showing the company owes you money.

You can withdraw your own company’s application to be struck off if you’re a director.
