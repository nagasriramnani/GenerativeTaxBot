Telling beneficiaries about tax and income

You must give the beneficiary a statement with the amount of income and tax paid by the trust, if they ask. You can use form R185 (trust) to do this. There’s a different form if you need to provide a statement to a settlor who retains an interest.

If there’s more than one beneficiary, you must give each of them this information relative to the amount they receive.

Death benefit payments from a pension scheme

You must give the beneficiary extra information if both the following apply:

you make a payment funded by a taxable lump sum from a pension scheme

the pension holder has died

Use form R185 (LSDB) if you’re a trustee. There’s a different form if you’re a pension administrator.

You must tell the beneficiary within 30 days.
