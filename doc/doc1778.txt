Trusts that qualify for special tax treatment

A trust does not qualify for special Income Tax treatment if the person setting it up can benefit from the trust income. However, from 2008 to 2009 it would qualify for special Capital Gains Tax treatment.

Trusts for children who’ve lost a parent are usually set up by the parent’s will, or by special rules of inheritance if there’s no will.

If someone dies without a will in Scotland, a trust set up there for their children is usually treated as a bare trust for tax purposes.

If there’s more than one beneficiary

If there are beneficiaries who are not vulnerable, the assets and income for the vulnerable beneficiary must be:

identified and kept separate

used only for that person

Only that part of the trust gets special tax treatment.
