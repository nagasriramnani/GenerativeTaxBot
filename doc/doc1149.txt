The court hearing

Overview

You can apply to the court to close or ‘wind up’ a company if it cannot pay its debts. This is also known as compulsory liquidation.

To wind up a company you must:

be owed £750 or more

be able to prove that the company cannot pay you

You need to fill in forms and send them to the right court to apply to wind up a company.

Your application to the court is known as a ‘winding-up petition’. If you’re successful:

the company assets are sold

any legal disputes are settled

the company collects money it’s owed

funds are paid to you and any other creditors

You might not get all or any of the money you’re owed.
