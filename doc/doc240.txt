6% of your income over the threshold if you’re on a Postgraduate Loan plan

The examples show how much you’d repay depending on your income and plan type:

Example

You’re on Plan 1 and have an income of £33,000 a year, meaning you get paid £2,750 each month.

Calculation:

£2,750 – £1,834 (your income minus the Plan 1 threshold) = £916
9% of £916 = £82

This means the amount you’d repay each month would be £82.

Example

You’re on Plan 4 and have an income of £30,000 a year, meaning you get paid £2,500 each month.

Calculation:

£2,500 – £2,305 (your income minus the Plan 4 threshold) = £195
9% of £195 = £18

This means the amount you’d repay each month would be £18.
