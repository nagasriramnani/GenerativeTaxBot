Example

You invoiced a customer on 28 March 2022. You record that invoice for the 2021 to 2022 tax year -  even if you did not receive the money until the next tax year.

Cash basis accounting

Most small businesses with an income of Â£150,000 or less can use cash basis reporting.

With this method, you only record income or expenses when you receive money or pay a bill. This means you will not need to pay Income Tax on money you have not yet received in your accounting period.

Example

You invoiced someone on 15 March 2022 but did not receive the money until 30 April 2022. Record this income for the 2022 to 2023 tax year.
