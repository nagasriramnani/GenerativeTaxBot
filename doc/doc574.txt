Work out what you can claim

What you can claim under writing down allowances depends on what ‘pool’ you put an asset in. Each pool has a different rate.

Work out your allowance

Work out what you can claim separately for each pool.

Take your closing balance from your last accounting period.

Add the value of anything you’ve bought or been given in the current period that qualifies for this pool. Only include VAT if you’re not VAT registered.

Deduct the value of anything you sold or ‘disposed of’ that originally qualified for this pool.

Work out how much you can claim using the correct rate for that pool.
