Disincorporation relief

You may be able to claim Disincorporation Relief if you become a partnership or sole trader having been a limited company.

If you acquire the company’s assets when it changes its business structure, you may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you sell or dispose of them later - you’ll use their value, including any Disincorporation Relief, when you acquired them.

You can get help from an accountant or tax adviser.
