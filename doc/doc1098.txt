Standard annual earnings period method

This method is common for directors who are paid irregularly.

Each time you pay a director, work out their National Insurance for their total pay over the tax year so far, including bonuses.

To work out what contributions they now owe, take off the total employee National Insurance theyâ€™ve paid so far this year.

Alternative method

This method is common for directors who are paid regularly.

Each time you pay a director, work out their National Insurance only on their pay for that period, including bonuses.

At the end of the tax year, use payroll software to work out whether more employee National Insurance is due and deduct it from their last payment.
