National Insurance for company directors

Directors are classed as employees and pay National Insurance on annual income from salary and bonuses over £12,570.

Contributions are worked out from their annual earnings rather than from what they earn in each pay period.

There are different rules for tax on dividends.

Companies also pay employer’s National Insurance on directors’ salaries. This applies even if you’re the director of your own company running payroll and the only employee.

If you’re running payroll

Use payroll software to work out the National Insurance due.

There are 2 different ways of doing this. You may be able to change your method during the tax year depending on your payroll software.
