What happens next

If your claim is accepted, the court will issue an order to restore a company - you’ll be sent this, and you must send it on to the Registrar of Companies. Once they have it they will restore the company.

You’ll then need to take further action to try and get your money:

get a ‘judgment’ from court for the amount of the money you’re owed together with interest and costs

issue a statutory demand

take out a winding up petition
