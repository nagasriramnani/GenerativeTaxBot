Returnable deposits

You may ask your customers to pay a deposit when they hire goods from you. You do not have to account for VAT if the deposit is either:

refunded in full to the customer when they return the goods safely

kept by you to compensate you for loss or damage

Read guidance manual VATSC05820 for more detailed information on the treatment of deposits for the supply of goods or services. Section 7 of VAT Notice 709/3 explains the VAT treatment of deposits for hotel accommodation.

Forfeit deposits

If you ask your customer for a deposit against goods or services you will supply at a future date.
