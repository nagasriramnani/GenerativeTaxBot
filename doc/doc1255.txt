You can nominate one property as your main home by writing to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Include the address of the home you want to nominate. All the owners of the property must sign the letter.

If you want to nominate a home you must do this within 2 years every time your combination of homes changes.

If you do not nominate a home and you sell one of your properties you must work out the time you live away.

Overseas properties

From 6 April 2015, you can only nominate an overseas property if you lived in it for at least 90 days in the tax year.
