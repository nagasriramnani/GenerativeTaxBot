Bereavement Support Payment if your partner has died 
Guardian's Allowance if you're bringing up a child whose parents have died

and
                  
                
              

              
                Deal with your own benefits, pension and taxes
              
          


          
              Your tax, benefit claims and pension might change depending on your relationship with the person who died.
