HMRC failed to act on information you gave them about the same source of income more than once

it’s the first time HMRC have told you that you owe tax for an earlier tax year - the reason you owe tax for an earlier tax year and the last tax year must be the same

the tax you owe has built up over 2 whole tax years or more

you have a reasonable belief that your tax affairs were in order for the years you owed the tax and HMRC agree

How to apply

You can apply by calling or writing to HMRC.

You should do this before you pay any of the tax you owe. But if you’ve already made a payment, HMRC may be able to refund it.

You must tell HMRC:

which arrears you’re disputing, including the tax year

the information HMRC should have acted on and when it was provided
