Before the first appointment

You and your ex-partner need to fill in a financial statement for a financial order (Form E) to show a breakdown of your property and debts. This includes giving an estimate of your future living costs.

You’ll also need to collect documents about your finances, for example:

rental or mortgage agreements

pension documents

loan agreements

proof of your salary income, for example P60 or recent pay slips

details of personal belongings worth more than £500, for example a car or house contents

How long it takes

It depends on:

how many financial dispute resolution appointments you need

if you need a final hearing
