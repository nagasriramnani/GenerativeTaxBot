Work out the daily interest: divide your yearly interest from step 1 by 365 (the number of days in a year).

Work out the total amount of interest: multiply the daily interest from step 2 by the number of days the debt has been overdue.

Example

If you were owed £1,000:

the annual interest would be £80 (1000 x 0.08 = 80)

you’d divide £80 by 365 to get the daily interest: about 22p a day (80 / 365 = 0.22)

after 50 days this would be £11 (50 x 0.22 = 11)
