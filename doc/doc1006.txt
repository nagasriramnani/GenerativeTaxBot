Hiring out a means of transport

A means of transport is something that can be used for transporting passengers or goods, and includes:

road transport

caravans and trailers

motor cycles and bicycles

ships and yachts

aircraft

railway rolling stock

It does not include freight containers, static caravans or racing cars.

Working out the place of supply when youâ€™re hiring out a means of transport depends upon the length of time that you hire out the vehicles.

Long term hires last either more than:

90 days for boats and ships

30 days for other vehicles, these come under the general rule

For short term hires the place of supply is where the vehicle is physically given to the customer.
