You must tell the beneficiary within 30 days.

Other responsibilities

You may have to report other things to HMRC. You need to:

use the online service to tell HMRC if there are any changes to the trust

fill in form IHT100 when the trust needs to pay Inheritance Tax

Your other responsibilities as a trustee depend on the type of trust and any instructions from the person who set up the trust in the trust deed.
