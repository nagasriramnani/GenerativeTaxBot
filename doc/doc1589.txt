Employee shareholder shares

To be an employee shareholder, you must own shares in your employer’s company that were worth at least £2,000 when you got them.

You will not usually pay Income Tax or National Insurance on the first £2,000 worth of employee shareholder shares you get before 1 December 2016.

You will not get tax relief if you or someone you’re connected with (like a business partner, spouse or family member) have 25% or more voting rights in the company.
