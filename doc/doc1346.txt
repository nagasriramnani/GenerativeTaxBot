Work out the value manually

You can also work out the value manually on P11D working sheet 2. You’ll have to use this method if both of the following apply during the tax year you’re reporting on:

the car was unavailable for at least 30 consecutive days

you were providing fuel for private use, but stopped doing this

Taxable value of cars

The taxable value of a car is not the same as its cost. The taxable value also depends on:

the car’s fuel type and level of CO2 emissions

the amount of time the car is unavailable during the tax year (for example, because of a mechanical fault)
