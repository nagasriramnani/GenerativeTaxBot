If you sell it for more than it cost you

You can only deduct the original cost of the item even if you sell it for more.

If a connected person sold it to you for less than it cost them, deduct either how much you sell it for or how much it cost them - whicheverâ€™s smaller.

Add the difference to your profits in your tax return if the value of the item is more than the amount in your pool. This is a balancing charge.
