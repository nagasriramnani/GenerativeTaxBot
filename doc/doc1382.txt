Contact your employer if you do not have your P60, P45 or form P11D.

You should also keep details of any other income or benefits from your job, including:

any tips received (unless your employer pays them through the ‘tronc’ system, which means they will have deducted tax already)

benefits you get in connection with your job from someone other than your employer, like meal vouchers

any lump sum payments not included on your P60 or P45, like incentive payments or ‘golden hellos’ (payments you get to encourage you to take a new job)
