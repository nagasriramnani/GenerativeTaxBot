If you’re using an agent, you can still sign up for a VAT online account when you receive your VAT number (select option ‘VAT submit returns’).

When you cannot register online

You must register by post using VAT1 if:

you want to apply for a ‘registration exception’

you’re joining the Agricultural Flat Rate Scheme

you’re registering the divisions or business units of a body corporate under separate VAT numbers

Register by post using:

form VAT1A if you’re an EU business ‘distance selling’ to Northern Ireland

form VAT1B if you import (‘acquire’) goods into Northern Ireland worth more than £85,000 from an EU country

form VAT1C if you’re disposing of assets and you have claimed Directive refunds on them
