Appoint someone to apply on your behalf

You can appoint someone to apply for you if either:

you’re the only executor named in the will

there are other executors named in the will, but all of them are either holding ‘power reserved’ or have given up their right to apply permanently

Fill in form PA11 to appoint someone to apply for you.

Alternatively, you can appoint an attorney to apply for you using a signed enduring power of attorney (EPA) or a registered lasting power of attorney (LPA).

If an executor is unable to apply

Check who can apply for probate if an executor has died or is unable to apply because they have a mental health condition or impairment.
