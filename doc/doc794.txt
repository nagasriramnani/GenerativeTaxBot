Tax is taken off the remaining amount before you get it.

Example:
Your whole pension is worth £60,000. You take £15,000 tax-free. Your pension provider takes tax off the remaining £45,000.

When you can take your pension depends on your pension’s rules. It’s usually 55 at the earliest.

You might have to pay Income Tax at a higher rate if you take a large amount from your pension. You could also owe extra tax at the end of the tax year.
