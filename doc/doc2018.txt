Pay your Simple Assessment tax bill

You must pay your Simple Assessment tax bill if you’ve been sent a letter by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

You may get a Simple Assessment letter if you:

owe Income Tax that cannot be automatically taken out of your income

owe HMRC £3,000 or more

have to pay tax on the State Pension

If you think any information in the letter is wrong or you cannot pay your bill on time, you must contact HMRC within 60 days.

You’ll need your Charge Reference Number when you pay. You’ll find it on your Simple Assessment letter.

Make an online payment

You can pay by:

approving a payment through your online bank account - you’ll be asked to sign in to your online bank account

debit or corporate credit card
