If the estate of the first of the couple to die is worth more than £2 million, tapering will reduce the amount of the unused residence nil rate band in that estate. This in turn reduces the amount of residence nil rate band that is transferable to the surviving spouse or civil partner’s estate.

Example

A man dies in the tax year 2018 to 2019 leaving an estate worth £2,100,000.

He leaves:

a £450,000 home to his wife

everything else to his children

The maximum residence nil rate band in the tax year 2018 to 2019 is £125,000. But as his children do not inherit the home, his estate cannot use any residence nil rate band.

Without the effect of tapering, he would have unused residence nil rate band of £125,000.
