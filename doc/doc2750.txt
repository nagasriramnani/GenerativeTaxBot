Tax if you live abroad and sell your UK home

You may have to pay tax when you sell (or ‘dispose of’) your UK home if you’re not UK resident for tax purposes.

Even if you have no tax to pay, you must tell HMRC you’ve sold the property within 60 days of transferring ownership (conveyancing).

The rules are different if you’re UK resident and sell your home.

As a non-resident you only pay tax on any gain made since 5 April 2015. You may get some tax relief.

When you get tax relief

In most cases you don’t pay any tax for any tax years in which you, your spouse or civil partner spent at least 90 days in your UK home.
