Incorporation Relief

You may be able to delay paying Capital Gains Tax if you transfer your business to a company in return for shares.

Incorporation Relief means you will not pay any tax until you sell (or ‘dispose of’) the shares.

Eligibility

To qualify for Incorporation Relief, you must:

be a sole trader or in a business partnership

transfer the business and all its assets (except cash) in return for shares in the company

How to claim

You do not have to claim Incorporation Relief - you’ll get it automatically if you’re eligible.

To work out the amount you need to pay Capital Gains Tax on, deduct the gain you made when selling your business from the market value of the shares you received.
