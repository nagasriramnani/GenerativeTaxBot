To grant someone employee shareholder status in your company, you need to award them at least £2,000 worth of shares.

Agree an employee shareholder valuation

Fill in a VAL232 form to get an employee shareholder valuation.

SAV may need to ask further questions based on your answers. It will only ask for information it considers relevant.

If you have any additional information that is not asked for on the VAL232 form and may help with its valuation, you can provide this with your form on a separate sheet. This might include:

any special features of the business

relevant financial affairs of the company, directors or shareholders

Once you’ve completed the form, you’ll be able to print a copy and post it to SAV.
