If you have other income

You’re responsible for paying any tax you owe on income other than money from your pensions. You might have to fill in a Self Assessment tax return.

You can claim a tax refund if you’ve paid too much tax.

Tax codes

If your income only comes from one source you’ll usually have one tax code.

You can have several tax codes if you have income from more than one source.

You can get your tax code corrected if you think it’s wrong.
