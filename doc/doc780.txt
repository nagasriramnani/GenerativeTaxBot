How you appeal against a decision depends on if it’s direct or indirect tax.

You must appeal direct tax decisions to HMRC before you can appeal to the tribunal.

You can usually appeal indirect tax decisions straight to the tribunal.
Before appealing to the tribunal, you can apply for a statutory review. This can be quicker and cheaper than going to the tribunal. You can still appeal to the tribunal if you do not agree with the outcome.

You must appeal within the time limit - it’ll usually be on any decision letter you get.
