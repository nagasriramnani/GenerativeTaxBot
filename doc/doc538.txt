The person who inherits the home does not have to be under 18. A person’s step-child is only someone whose parent is, or was, the spouse or civil partner of that person.

Direct descendants do not include nephews, nieces, siblings and other relatives who are not included in the list above.

One or more direct descendants of the person that’s died can inherit a home, or a share of it.

For a home left to people who are a mixture of direct descendants, other relatives or other people, you must share the value of the home in proportion to the share of the property each direct descendant inherits.

Example

A woman dies in tax year 2020 to 2021. Her estate includes a home worth £500,000.

In her will she leaves half of the property to her step-son and half to her nephew.
