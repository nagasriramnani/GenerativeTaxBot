Gifts of agricultural property

If a gift (or portion of a gift) qualified for Agricultural Relief at the time it was made, it will still qualify if it:

has been held by the person who received it until their own death or that of the person who gave the gift

is agricultural property that has been occupied for agricultural purposes since the gift was made

If the person receiving the gift dies before the person who gave the gift, conditions for relief have to be met both on the date that the gift is given and at the time of their death.

If the person receiving a gift sells it, before the death of the person giving the gift, to a company in exchange for shares in that company then those shares are treated as the original property.
