You may be able to delay making an import declaration if you import a vehicle from Ireland. This is called a delayed declaration.

If you’re unable to use the NOVA online service, ask the Imports and exports helpline for a VAT NOVA1 form.

For help completing a NOVA application, contact the HMRC Personal Transport Unit.

If you’re a non-VAT registered company or private individual

HMRC will make a NOVA application for you, but you will need to make an import declaration and send it to HMRC by email.

You can also get an agent such as a freight forwarder to make an import declaration for you. They may make the NOVA application for you as well.
