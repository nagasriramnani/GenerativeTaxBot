Find your UTR number

You get a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) when you:

register for Self Assessment

set up a limited company

It’s a 10-digit number. It might just be called ‘tax reference’.

You’ll get your UTR by post 10 days after you register. You can usually see it sooner in your Personal Tax Account or the HMRC app.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Where to find your UTR

You can find your UTR number:

in your Personal Tax Account

in the HMRC app

on previous tax returns and other documents from HMRC (for example, notices to file a return or payment reminders)

Get help from HMRC

If you cannot find your UTR on any documents or online, request it by calling the Self Assessment helpline. They’ll post it to you - this takes around 10 days.
