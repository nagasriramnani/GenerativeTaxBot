Overview

You usually have to pay tax on your UK income even if you’re not a UK resident. Income includes things like:

pension

rental income

savings interest

wages

If you’re eligible for a Personal Allowance you pay Income Tax on your income above that amount. Otherwise, you pay tax on all your income.

The country where you live might tax you on your UK income. If it has a ‘double-taxation agreement’ with the UK, you can claim tax relief in the UK to avoid being taxed twice.

You do not normally pay tax when you sell an asset, apart from on UK property or land.
