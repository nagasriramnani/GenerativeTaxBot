Changing your bank details

You must tell HMRC at least 14 days in advance if you’re changing your bank details.

If you pay your VAT by Direct Debit, you’ll need to tell your bank as well. Do not do this in the 5 banking days before or after your VAT return is due - it could mean you get charged twice.

If you use the Annual Accounting Scheme, you must write to the Annual Accounting Registration Unit to change your Direct Debit details. Include your registration number.
