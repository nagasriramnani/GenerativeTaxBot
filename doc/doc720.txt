How to get a VAT refund

Get a VAT 407(NI) form from the retailer. They will ask for proof that you’re eligible, for example your passport and travel documents.

Complete the VAT 407(NI) form. Only include the goods you’re taking out of the country. Do not include any goods you’re leaving behind, any goods you’ve used or or any goods you’ve returned.

Show the goods, the completed form and your receipts to customs at the point when you leave Northern Ireland or the EU.

Customs will approve your form if everything is in order.

To get paid, either take your approved form to the VAT refund desk at the airport, or send it to the retailer or refund provider with evidence of where you’re travelling to.
