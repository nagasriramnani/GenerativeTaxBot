If you’re reporting gains on property using a Capital Gains Tax on UK property account, you must include details of your gain and any tax you’ve paid in your tax return.

Do not wait until the next tax year to report gains on UK residential property sold since 6 April 2020. You may have to pay interest and a penalty if you do.

You can get help with your tax return from an accountant or tax adviser.

After you’ve submitted a return, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will tell you how much you owe, how to pay and when to pay.

Report using the ‘real time’ Capital Gains Tax service

You can use the service to report gains on assets you sold during the tax year:
