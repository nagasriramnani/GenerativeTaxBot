You may need to pay UK tax if you’re non-resident and have UK income. For example, you could be taxed if you have income from renting a property in the UK.

The UK has ‘double taxation agreements’ with many countries to make sure you do not pay tax twice.

National Insurance

You might be able to pay National Insurance while you’re abroad if you’re planning to:

come back to the UK

claim the State Pension later

You cannot claim back any National Insurance you’ve paid in the UK if you leave the UK permanently. However, anything you’ve paid might count towards benefits in the country you’re moving to - if it’s one of the countries that have a social security agreement with the UK.
