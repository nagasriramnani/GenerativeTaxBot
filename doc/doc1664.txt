Settlor-interested trusts

The settlor is responsible for Income Tax on these trusts, even if some of the income is not paid out to them. However, the Income Tax is paid by the trustees as they receive the income.

The trustees pay Income Tax on the trust income by filling out a Trust and Estate Tax Return.

They give the settlor a statement of all the income and the rates of tax charged on it.

The settlor tells HMRC about the tax the trustees have paid on their behalf on a Self Assessment tax return.

The rate of Income Tax depends on what type of trust the settlor-interested trust is.
