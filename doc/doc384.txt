Using your own vehicle for work

If you use your own vehicle or vehicles for work, you may be able to claim tax relief on the approved mileage rate. This covers the cost of owning and running your vehicle. You cannot claim separately for things like:

fuel

electricity

road tax

MOTs

repairs

To work out how much you can claim for each tax year you’ll need to:

keep records of the dates and mileage of your work journeys

add up the mileage for each vehicle type you’ve used for work

take away any amount your employer pays you towards your costs, (sometimes called a ‘mileage allowance’)
