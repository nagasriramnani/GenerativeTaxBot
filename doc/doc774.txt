How to register

Follow the instructions for registering a vehicle to fill in your forms and send supporting documents.

You must also send extra supporting documents for an imported vehicle.

DVLA might ask to inspect the vehicle.

Extra supporting documents for imported vehicles

You must send the following original documents:

proof of vehicle approval

form V267 (sometimes called the ‘declaration of newness’) if you’re registering a new vehicle

evidence showing the date the vehicle was collected, for example the invoice from the supplier

the original foreign registration certificate to show when the vehicle was manufactured (you will not get this back)
