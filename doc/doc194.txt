The court may decide to:

order a deduction from your earnings

freeze money in your bank or building society account

deduct the money you owe when you sell your property (such as a house, land, stocks or shares)

order you to come to court to answer questions about things like your earnings or employment status

If you have other judgments or debts

If you have another judgment against you, you can arrange to pay all your debts to the court in a single weekly or monthly payment.

This will stop people taking action against you to get their money - for example by sending bailiffs to your home.

You can only do this if your total debts are under £5,000.

You’ll need to fill in the application for an administration order (N92).

Contact the court if you cannot keep up with the payments.
