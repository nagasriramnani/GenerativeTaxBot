If you’re allowed, you will not be charged a penalty unless you miss the deadline or make a careless or deliberate error. You’ll normally have to give the correct figures in your next VAT Return.

Claiming relief on bad debts

If a customer does not pay you for goods or services, you can write off the invoice as a ‘bad debt’. If you’re in this situation, you might be able to claim relief from VAT.

To qualify for the relief:

the debt must be older than 6 months

you must submit your claim within 4 years and 6 months of the date the payment was due or the date of supply (whichever was later)

you must not have sold the debt on

you must not have charged more than the normal price for the item

You need to keep records about the debt. Submit your claim for a refund in your VAT Return.
