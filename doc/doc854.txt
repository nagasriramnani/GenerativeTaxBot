You’ll usually get the grant of probate or letters of administration within 16 weeks of submitting your application. It can take longer if you need to provide additional information.

If you ordered copies of your probate document for use outside the UK, these will take longer to arrive than your UK copy.

If there’s anything wrong with the probate document, return it to the district probate registry listed on the grant or letters.

What happens next

Once you have the grant of probate (or letters of administration) you can start dealing with the estate.

Send copies of the probate document to organisations that hold the assets of the person who died, for example their bank.
