If you didn’t pay it while you were abroad, you can check your National Insurance record to see how your State Pension might be affected.

Find your National Insurance number if you’ve lost it.

You don’t always need to pay National Insurance if you’re not coming to the UK permanently.

Contact the International Pension Centre if you want to move a pension to the UK.
