Foreign students usually do not pay UK tax on foreign income or gains, as long as they’re used for course fees or living costs like:

food

rent

bills

study materials

Check that the country your income’s from has a ‘double-taxation agreement’ that covers students.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) may ask you to account for your living costs if they’re more than £15,000 in a tax year (excluding course fees). The tax year is from 6 April to 5 April the following year.
