Late registration

If you register late, you must pay VAT on any sales you’ve made since the date you should have registered.

You might need to pay a penalty, depending on how much you owe and how late your registration is.

If you go over the threshold temporarily

You can apply for a registration ‘exception’ if your taxable turnover goes over the threshold temporarily.

Write to HMRC with evidence showing why you believe your VAT taxable turnover will not go over the deregistration threshold of £83,000 in the next 12 months.

HMRC will consider your exception and write to confirm if you get one. If not, they’ll register you for VAT.
