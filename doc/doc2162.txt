you must use the old and new assets in your business

You can claim relief on assets including:

land and buildings

fixed plant or machinery, for example a printing press

Partial relief

There are different rules if:

you only reinvest part of the proceeds from selling the old assets

the old assets were only partly used in your business

you use the proceeds to buy ‘depreciating assets’ (fixed plant or machinery, or assets expected to last for less than 60 years)

Get help from a professional, for example an accountant or tax adviser, if you need advice.
