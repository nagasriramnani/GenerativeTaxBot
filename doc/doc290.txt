Rules on giving gifts

Inheritance Tax may have to be paid after your death on some gifts youâ€™ve given.

Gifts given less than 7 years before you die may be taxed depending on:

who you give the gift to and their relationship to you

when the gift was given

You can get professional advice from a solicitor or a tax adviser about what you can give away tax free during your lifetime.

What counts as a gift

Gifts include:

money

household and personal goods, for example, furniture, jewellery or antiques

a house, land or buildings
