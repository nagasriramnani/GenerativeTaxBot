It can be removed if you can prove you (as the bankrupt) do not have a share in the property, for example if your partner owns the property. The owner has to send HM Land Registry a signed statement saying they are not the bankrupt person and an application for the cancellation of a Form J restriction.

Stop the sale of your home

You might be able to stop or delay the sale of your home if, for example:

the value of your equity is less than Â£1,000

the equity or legal title can be sold to someone else, such as a partner

you need to organise somewhere for children or a partner to live - the sale can be delayed for up to 1 year

You may want to get legal advice to find out if you can stop or delay the sale of your home.
