Value the estate and work out Inheritance Tax

Before applying for probate, you must find out if you need to pay Inheritance Tax.

To do this, you need to estimate the value of the estate of the person who died. Even if there’s no tax to pay, you’ll need the value as part of your probate application.

Apply for probate

You can apply for probate online or by post after you’ve valued the estate.
