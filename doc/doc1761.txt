Eligibility

You can only use a margin scheme for:

second-hand goods

works of art

antiques and collectors’ items

Second-hand goods

Goods that can still be used, or which could be used after repair.

Works of art

Most items normally described as ‘works of art’ are eligible. There are some exceptions, for example technical drawings, scenery for theatres and hand-decorated manufactured items.

Antiques and collectors’ items

Antiques are goods that are over 100 years old. Collectors’ items are stamps, coins and currency and other pieces of scientific, historical or archaeological interest. Not all items that can be collected are eligible for a margin scheme.
