This means you will now pay tax on £190, but your partner will only pay tax on £6,170. As a couple you benefit, as you are only paying Income Tax on £6,360 rather than £7,430, which saves you £214 in tax.

Who can apply

You can benefit from Marriage Allowance if all the following apply:

you’re married or in a civil partnership

you do not pay Income Tax or your income is below your Personal Allowance (usually £12,570)

your partner pays Income Tax at the basic rate, which usually means their income is between £12,571 and £50,270 before they receive Marriage Allowance

You cannot claim Marriage Allowance if you’re living together but you’re not married or in a civil partnership.
