You can sometimes pay for gaps from more than 6 years ago, depending on your age.

You’re a man born after 5 April 1951 or a woman born after 5 April 1953

You have until 31 July 2023 to pay voluntary contributions to make up for gaps between tax years April 2006 and April 2016 if you’re eligible.

After 31 July 2023 you’ll only be able to pay for voluntary contributions for the past 6 years. This may not be enough to qualify for a new State Pension if you have fewer than 4 qualifying years on your National Insurance record. You’ll usually need at least 10 qualifying years in total.
