For freight transport the place of supply varies according to whether the customer is in business.

The rule for working out the place of supply of freight transport is if you supply services to a:

business customer, the place of supply is the place where the customer belongs

non-business customer, the place of supply is where the transport takes place

VAT Notice 744B: freight transport and associated services has more about the VAT rules for freight transport services.

Services you supply outside the UK

If youâ€™re supplying services to non-business customers outside the UK, you may not need to pay UK VAT.

These are mainly intangible services that include advertising, intellectual property rights, legal services and accountancy.
