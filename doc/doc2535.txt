How much tax you pay

Previous tax years

Previous tax years

If you’re self-employed and need to declare savings interest from a previous tax year, you’ll have to report it in a Self-Assessment tax return.

HMRC automatically deducts tax on any savings interest you owe, if you’re employed or get a pension.

Reclaim tax from previous years

You can reclaim tax paid on your savings interest if your income was below your Personal Allowance. You must reclaim your tax within 4 years of the end of the relevant tax year.
