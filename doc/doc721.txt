If you’re changing planes in an EU country and checking in your goods with your luggage, you must do step 3 in Northern Ireland when you check in.

If you lose your VAT 407(NI) form, you can ask the retailer for a replacement.

Getting paid

You can either get paid immediately at a refund booth, for example at the airport, or send the approved form to the retailer or their refund company. The retailer will tell you how you’ll get paid.

If you’re travelling to Great Britain the retailer will tell you if you need to send them copies of your travel documents.

Some retailers charge a fee for handling your form. This money will be deducted from your refund.
