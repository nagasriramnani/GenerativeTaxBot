You’ll still be responsible for keeping these records if you outsource self-billing to a third party provider.

If you do not keep the required records, then the self-billed invoices you issue will not be proper VAT invoices.

Self-billing invoices

Once you’ve got a self-billing agreement with a supplier, you must issue self-billed invoices for all the transactions with them during the period of the agreement.

As well as all the details that must go on a full VAT invoice you’ll also need to include your supplier’s:

name

address

VAT registration number

All self-billed invoices must include the statement ‘The VAT shown is your output tax due to HMRC’.

Remember that you do not add any VAT to self-billed invoices that you issue to suppliers who are not VAT registered.
