Appeal against a penalty

You can appeal to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) against a penalty, for example for:

an inaccurate return

sending in your tax return late

paying tax late

failing to keep adequate records

How you appeal depends if the penalty is for either:

indirect tax, for example VAT, Customs Duty or Excise Duty

direct tax, for example Income Tax, Corporation Tax or Capital Gains Tax

Your penalty may be cancelled or amended if you have a reasonable excuse.
