Find out what to do if you have a debt that you cannot pay.

You might be arrested if you do not pay criminal debts, such as fines or penalty notices.

Dealing with bailiffs

You usually do not have to open your door to a bailiff or let them in.

Bailiffs cannot enter your home:

by force, for example by pushing past you

if only children under 16 or vulnerable people (with disabilities, for example) are present

between 9pm and 6am

through anything except the door

Bailiffs are allowed to force their way into your home to collect unpaid criminal fines, Income Tax or Stamp Duty, but only as a last resort.

If you do not let a bailiff in or agree to pay them:

they could take things from outside your home, for example your car

you could end up owing even more money
