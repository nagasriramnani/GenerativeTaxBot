Representatives from the organisation you’re appealing against may come to the hearing.

The hearing will be open to members of the public.

You can also ask any of the following people to the hearing:

a representative, if you have one

a friend, family member or colleague

a witness, if you need one

If you’re having a video hearing, you’ll need to tell the tribunal if any of these people are coming so they can be given access to the hearing.

The tribunal will not pay for any travel or accommodation costs to allow you or any of these people to attend the hearing.

What happens at the hearing

You (or your representative) will present your case to the tribunal. You must explain:

what has been agreed

what you think is wrong
