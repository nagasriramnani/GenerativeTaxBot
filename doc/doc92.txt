Tax on a private pension you inherit

You may have to pay tax on payments you get from someone else’s pension pot after they die.

There are different rules on inheriting the State Pension.

Who can get payments

The person who died will usually have nominated you (told their pension provider to give you money from their pension pot).

But sometimes the provider can pay the money to someone else, for example if the nominated person cannot be found or has died.

A pension from a defined benefit pot can usually only be paid to a dependant of the person who died, for example a husband, wife, civil partner or child under 23. It can sometimes be paid to someone else if the pension scheme’s rules allow it - but it will be taxed at up to 55% as an unauthorised payment.
