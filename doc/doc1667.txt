Check your National Insurance record

You can check your National Insurance record online to see:

what you’ve paid, up to the start of the current tax year (6 April 2023)

any National Insurance credits you’ve received

if gaps in contributions or credits mean some years do not count towards your State Pension (they are not ‘qualifying years’)

if you can pay voluntary contributions to fill any gaps and how much this will cost

Your online record does not cover how much State Pension you’re likely to get.

This service is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
