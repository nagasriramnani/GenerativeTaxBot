Before you apply for probate

You need to calculate the following 3 values so you can report the estate’s value:

the estate’s gross value - this includes the total value of all the person’s assets  and any gifts they made in the 7 years before they died

the estate’s net value - this is the gross value minus any debts, such as a mortgage or funeral costs

the estate’s net qualifying value - this is the net value minus any assets left to spouses, civil partners, charities or assets that are exempt for other reasons

You can use the online checker tool to help you calculate these values.

Example

The person died on 2 January 2022 leaving an estate worth £285,000, which is below the Inheritance Tax threshold. They left the estate to their daughter and a small amount to charity.
