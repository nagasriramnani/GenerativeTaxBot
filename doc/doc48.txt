Read section 8 of the guidance to VAT rules and procedures to find out how ‘apportionment’ works.

Link-save offers

Link-save offers are where the customer gets a discounted (or free) second item with their purchase, for example ‘buy one, get one free’.

Use ‘apportionment’ to work out the VAT, unless the free or discounted item:

has a resale value of less than £1

has a sale value of less than £5

costs you less than 20% of the total of the other items in the offer

is not sold at a separate price from the main product

If any of the above apply, charge VAT on the combined value of items.

Charging VAT on coupons or vouchers

Do not charge VAT on either of the following:

a money-off coupon or voucher you give away free with another item at the time of purchase
