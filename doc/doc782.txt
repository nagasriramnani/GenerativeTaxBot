Appeal about seized goods

You must ask Border Force or HMRC to take your case to the magistrates’ court (this is known as starting ‘condemnation proceedings’) if you think they should not have taken (or ‘seized’) your goods.

You may be able to appeal to the tribunal if Border Force or HMRC:

refuses to return your seized goods

says you need to pay to get your seized goods back

Before you can appeal against a refusal to return your seized goods, you must ask either Border Force or HMRC to review their decision. If you’ve missed the deadline for a review, you can apply to the tribunal to be allowed to request a late review.

If you’ve been asked to pay duty or a penalty

You may be able to appeal if HMRC:

sends you an assessment for duty

charges you a penalty
