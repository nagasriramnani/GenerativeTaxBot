If you are VAT-registered and incur VAT on any items that will be used to make exempt supplies, you are classed as partly exempt.

Exempt goods and services

There are some goods and services on which VAT is not charged, including:

insurance, finance and credit

education and training

fundraising events by charities

subscriptions to membership organisations

selling, leasing and letting of commercial land and buildings â€” this exemption can be waived

These items are exempt from VAT so are not taxable. You do not include sales of exempt goods or services in your taxable turnover for VAT purposes. And if you buy exempt items, there is no VAT to reclaim.
