an individual working out your Capital Gain liability

a company working out your Corporation Tax liability

This is called a Post Transaction Valuation Check.

You must fill in a CG34 form for us to carry out a Post Transaction Valuation Check, then send it to the address on the form.

Individuals can only request a Post Transaction Valuation Check:

after disposals relevant to Capital Gains Tax

before the date you must file your Self Assessment tax return

We may ask you for further information after we review your CG34 form.

If we do not agree with your valuation we will suggest a different valuation to negotiate with you.
