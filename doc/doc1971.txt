Write your 11-character payment reference on the back of the cheque. This is your 10-digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) followed by the letter ‘K’. You’ll find this on your payslip.

Include the payslip HMRC sent you (if you still get paper statements). Do not fold the payslip or cheque or fasten them together.

Your payment may be delayed if you do not fill in your cheque correctly.
