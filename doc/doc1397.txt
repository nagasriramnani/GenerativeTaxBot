Get money that's been paid into the Court Funds Office

You can ask for money owed to you that’s held in the Court Funds Office.

It will be money a defendant paid in either:

to use a defence that they made an offer to settle before the case started and you turned it down (sometimes called a ‘defence of tender before claim’)

when the court has ordered them to pay it in as part of a settlement that you’ve accepted

as part or all of a ‘part 36 offer’ to settle made before April 2007 but you’ve only now accepted it

You can ask for the money to be paid into either:

your bank account

your solicitor’s bank account

If you have legal aid charges to pay, the money must be paid into your solicitor’s bank account.
