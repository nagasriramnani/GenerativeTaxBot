other types of tax avoidance or tax evasion

There’s a different way to report suspicious HMRC emails, text messages and phone calls, benefit fraud (excluding Child Benefit and Tax Credit fraud) or other types of fraud, such as identity theft.

How to make a report

Fill in the online form to tell HMRC what you know about the person or business.

You do not have to give your name or contact details unless you want to. Any information you give will be kept private and confidential.

Do not send supporting information. You can tell HMRC if you have any when you make your report. HMRC will only ask for more information if needed, as long as you’ve given your contact details.

For your own safety you should not try to find out more or let anyone know you’re making a report.
