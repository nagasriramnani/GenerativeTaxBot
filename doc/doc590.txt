Working from home

Calculate your allowable expenses using a flat rate based on the hours you work from home each month.

This means you do not have to work out the proportion of personal and business use for your home, for example how much of your utility bills are for business.

The flat rate does not include telephone or internet expenses. You can claim the business proportion of these bills by working out the actual costs.

You can only use simplified expenses if you work for 25 hours or more a month from home.
