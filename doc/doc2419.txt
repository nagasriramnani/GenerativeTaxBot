Gaps in your National Insurance record

You may get gaps in your record if you do not pay National Insurance or do not get National Insurance credits. This could be because you were:

employed but had low earnings

unemployed and were not claiming benefits

self-employed but did not pay contributions because of small profits

living or working outside the UK

Gaps can mean you will not have enough years of National Insurance contributions to either:

get the full State Pension (sometimes called ‘qualifying years’)

qualify for some benefits
