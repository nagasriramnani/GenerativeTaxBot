Apply for help by post

If you apply for help with fees by post, you’ll need to make your court claim by post too. Apply for both at the same time.

Fill in form EX160 for help with fees.

Fill in form N1 to make a court claim for money.

Return both forms to the County Court Business Centre.

Pay the court fee

Pay by credit or debit card if you’re making a claim online.

If you use the paper claim form, pay by credit or debit card by sending a letter with your form asking to pay by card. Include your telephone number and a suitable time for the court to call you and take the payment.
