After you apply

This can take longer if the adjudicator needs to ask more questions about your application.

They’ll then issue a bankruptcy order.

After you get your bankruptcy order

You’ll get a letter from the official receiver within 2 weeks of getting your bankruptcy order. The official receiver is an officer of the court who manages your bankruptcy.
