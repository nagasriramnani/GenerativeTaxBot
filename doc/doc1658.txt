Tax if you return to the UK

If you come back to the UK after living abroad, you’ll usually be classed a UK resident again. This means you pay UK tax on:

your UK income and gains

any foreign income and gains - although you may not have to if your permanent home (‘domicile’) remains outside the UK

You stayed UK resident if you were abroad less than a full tax year (6 April to 5 April the following year). This means you usually pay UK tax on foreign income for the entire time you were away.

What to do when you’re back

You may need to register for Self Assessment, for example if you start working for yourself or have other income or gains from the UK or abroad.

You don’t need to register if you’re an employee and don’t have other untaxed income to report.
