Reporting your foreign income

You usually need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return if you’re a UK resident with foreign income or capital gains. But there’s some foreign income that’s taxed differently.

You do not need to fill in a tax return if all the following apply:

your only foreign income is dividends

your total dividends - including UK dividends - are less than the £2,000 dividend allowance

you have no other income to report

Different rules may apply if your permanent home (‘domicile’) is abroad.
