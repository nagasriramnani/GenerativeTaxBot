Appeal against a direct tax decision

Your decision letter will tell you how to make an appeal and when you must appeal by. The deadline is usually 30 days from the date of the letter.

If you or your business was affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) and the decision was dated before 1 October 2021, HMRC will give you an extra 3 months after the deadline to appeal. Send your appeal as soon as you can, and explain the delay is because of COVID-19.

You can either:

use the appeal form you got with your decision letter

write to HMRC at the address on the letter

If you do not have a letter you can write to the HMRC office related to your return.

You must include:

your name or business name

your tax reference number (this will be on the decision letter)

what you disagree with and why
