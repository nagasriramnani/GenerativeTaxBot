Service charges

These are added to the bill before it’s given to the customer.

If the charge is compulsory, it’s not a tip so if your employer gives it to you, it’s treated in the same way as your wages.

If it’s voluntary, you pay tax and National Insurance in the same way as for tips.

Bonuses

These are part of your pay and you’ll pay tax and National Insurance on them. Your employer will deduct these from your wages before you get them.

Cash in hand wage payments

It’s illegal for your employer to pay you your wages ‘cash in hand’ without deducting tax and National Insurance contributions.

You risk losing your employment rights if you accept cash in hand payments, and may have to pay the tax and National Insurance contributions yourself.
