You cannot pay by Direct Debit if you have a ‘payments on account’ arrangement.

Reference number

You’ll need your 9-digit VAT registration number to make a payment.

Find your registration number:

in your VAT online account

on your VAT registration certificate

Do not put any spaces between the digits when paying your VAT bill.

If you need to pay a VAT surcharge or penalty

You’ll need to give your 14-digit reference number beginning with ‘X’.

You can find your 14-digit reference number in the letter HMRC sent you about your surcharge or penalty.

If you use the Annual Accounting Scheme

Businesses that use the Annual Accounting Scheme can only set up an automatic Direct Debit online for balancing payments.

You can set up a Direct Debit for regular payments using form VAT 623.
