you sold the property before 6 April 2014

You get relief for the last 18 months if none of these apply, but you sold your home before 6 April 2020.

If you own more than one home

In most cases, you only get relief for one home for any period. You must work out when you lived in each property as your main home.

If you’re married or in a civil partnership only one home per couple counts as your main home for any period.

If you’ve nominated a home you cannot get relief for another property for the time your home is nominated, apart from for the periods that always qualify for relief.
