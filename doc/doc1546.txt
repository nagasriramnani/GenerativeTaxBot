Selling shares in the same company

There’s a different way of working out your cost if you’ve sold the same type of shares in a company that you bought at different times.

You’ll usually need to work out the average cost of your shares and deduct this from what you got for them to work out your gain.

Example

You buy 100 shares for 80p each. The total cost is £80.

You later buy 300 shares for £1.20 each. The total cost is £360.

In total, you have 400 shares costing £440 - the average cost of each share is £1.10.
