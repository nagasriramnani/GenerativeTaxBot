fill in a Self Assessment tax return and an SA109 form and send by post

use commercial Self Assessment software that supports SA109 reporting (this may appear as a ‘residence, remittance basis etc’ section)

get a tax professional to report your UK income for you

You’ll be fined if you miss the deadline - it’s earlier if you’re sending your return by post (31 October).

If you have overpaid

Apply for a refund if you think you’ve paid too much tax. This might happen if tax is deducted automatically (for example by your bank) but your total UK income is below your Personal Allowance.

Send form R43 to HMRC, or claim the refund in your Self Assessment tax return if you’re already doing one.
