Check your Income Tax for the current year

This service covers the current tax year (6 April 2023 to 5 April 2024).

This page is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Use the service to:

check your tax code and Personal Allowance

see your estimated income from any jobs and pensions and the tax you can expect to pay for the current tax year

update details of your income from jobs and pensions - you may pay too much or too little tax if theyâ€™re not up to date

see if your tax code has changed

tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) about changes that affect your tax code

update your employer or pension provider details

You cannot check your Income Tax for the current year if Self Assessment is the only way you pay Income Tax.
