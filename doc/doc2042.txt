Work out the available residence nil rate band

Use the RNRB calculator to work out how much residence nil rate band the estate may be entitled to. The calculator will partly complete form IHT435 for you.

The amount will be the lower of the:

value of the home, or share inherited by the direct descendants

maximum residence nil rate band available when the person died

The amount the estate is entitled to is reduced or tapered away for estates worth more than £2 million by £1 for every £2 over £2 million.

How to use the residence nil rate band

You subtract the allowance from the value of the whole estate, not just the value of the home.

The residence nil rate band includes any unused residence nil rate band transferred from a husband, wife or civil partner.
