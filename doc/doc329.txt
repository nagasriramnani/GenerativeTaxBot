If you report the value of the estate online to HMRC, you can apply for probate as soon as you’ve submitted the online form.

If you report the value by post, you must apply for probate:

before submitting form IHT205, if you’re applying for probate online

at the same time as form IHT205 (post both forms together), if you’re applying for probate by post

If there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay and the person died on or after 1 January 2022

You’ll need to report estimates of the estate’s value as part of your probate application. You do not need to also report it to HMRC.

You first need to estimate the estate’s value for Inheritance Tax. Then use that estimate to work out the gross and net values for probate.
