Beneficiaries - paying and reclaiming tax on trusts

If youâ€™re a trust beneficiary there are different rules depending on the type of trust. You might have to pay tax through Self Assessment or you might be entitled to a tax refund.

If you do not usually send a tax return and need to, you must register for Self Assessment by 5 October following the tax year you had the income.
