If you’re selling your business:

cancel your accountant’s access to your VAT online account - for example if you authorised them to deal with your VAT

cancel any direct debits on your VAT online account

You must also give your records to the buyer if you’re passing on your VAT number.

If you’re buying a business:

contact HMRC within 21 days of the transfer application if you want to keep the seller’s accountant

replace any self-billing arrangements with new ones

set up new direct debits on your VAT online account

If you prefer to get a new VAT number

If you want to get a new VAT number rather than keeping the existing one, you need to cancel the existing VAT registration and re-register for VAT.
