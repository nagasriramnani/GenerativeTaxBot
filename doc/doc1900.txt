Transferring any unused residence nil rate band

The estate’s personal representative will need to give details of the amount due and supporting information on the Inheritance Tax return.

They’ll make a claim to transfer any unused residence nil rate band from the estate of a late spouse or civil partner.

As the residence nil rate band and basic Inheritance Tax threshold are not linked, the percentages transferred can be different. This means that even if all of the basic Inheritance Tax threshold was used when the first of the couple died, you can still transfer the unused residence nil rate band.
