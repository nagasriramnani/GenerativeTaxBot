What trusts are for

Trusts are set up for a number of reasons, including:

to control and protect family assets

when someone’s too young to handle their affairs

when someone cannot handle their affairs because they’re incapacitated

to pass on assets while you’re still alive

to pass on assets when you die (a ‘will trust’)

under the rules of inheritance if someone dies without a will (in England and Wales)

What the settlor does

The settlor decides how the assets in a trust should be used - this is usually set out in a document called the ‘trust deed’.

Sometimes the settlor can also benefit from the assets in a trust - this is called a ‘settlor-interested’ trust and has special tax rules. Find out more by reading the information on different types of trust.
