Getting a customs identification number

If you plan to export goods you must get an Economic Operator Registration and Identification number (EORI).

Proof of export

to zero rate your exports you need documentary evidence of goods leaving either:

the UK from Great Britain

the UK and EU from Northern Ireland

This can be commercial or official evidence. If you do not get this evidence in time, you’ll have to account for the VAT on your return.

If you use the National Export System, you’ll automatically get an electronic Goods Departed Message when the goods leave the UK, and this is acceptable official evidence.
