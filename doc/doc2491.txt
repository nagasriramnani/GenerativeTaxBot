If you use the paper claim form, pay by credit or debit card by sending a letter with your form asking to pay by card. Include your telephone number and a suitable time for the court to call you and take the payment.

You can also pay by postal order or cheque (payable to ‘HM Courts and Tribunals Service’) if you use the paper claim form.

You may have to pay more fees later on - for example, if there’s a court hearing or you need to get a judgment enforced.

You may be able to claim the fees back if you win the case.
