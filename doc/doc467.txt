When you receive your VAT number from HMRC, you can sign up for a VAT online account (select option ‘VAT submit returns’).

After you’ve registered

You’ll get:

a 9-digit VAT number which you must include on all invoices you raise

information about when to submit your first VAT return and payment

confirmation of your registration date (known as your ‘effective date of registration’)

You’ll get this in your online VAT account or by post, depending on how you registered.

If you’ve already registered for VAT and you’re waiting to hear back, check when you should expect a reply.

When you can start charging and reclaiming VAT

You can start charging VAT on your sales and reclaiming VAT on items you bought from your ‘effective date of registration’.
