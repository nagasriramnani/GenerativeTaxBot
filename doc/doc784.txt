Appeal a WRA decision

You can appeal some Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA) decisions about Land Transaction Tax and Landfill Disposals Tax.

You can also apply to close an enquiry into your tax return.

You must appeal within the time limit - itâ€™ll usually be on your decision letter.

You must usually pay upfront what WRA says you owe. You can request to delay paying until you get a decision about your appeal. If you delay payment, you may be charged interest on the amount you owe.

Before you appeal, you can ask WRA to change their decision.
