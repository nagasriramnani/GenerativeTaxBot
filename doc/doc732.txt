Annual allowance

Your annual allowance is the most you can save in your pension pots in a tax year (6 April to 5 April) before you have to pay tax.

You’ll only pay tax if you go above the annual allowance. This is £60,000 this tax year.

What counts towards the annual allowance

Your annual allowance applies to all of your private pensions, if you have more than one. This includes:

the total amount paid in to a defined contribution scheme in a tax year by you or anyone else (for example, your employer)

any increase in a defined benefit scheme in a tax year
