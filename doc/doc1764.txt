What to include in a VAT Return

You’ll need to include:

your total sales and purchases

the amount of VAT you owe

the amount of VAT you can reclaim

the amount of VAT you’re owed from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) (if you’re reclaiming VAT on business expenses)

You must include the VAT on the full value of what you sell, even if you:

receive goods or services instead of money - for example if you take something in part-exchange

have not charged any VAT to the customer - whatever price you charge is treated as including VAT
