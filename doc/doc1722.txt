Not VAT-registered

If you’re a UK trader and not registered for UK VAT you still have to pay the import VAT, but you will not be able to reclaim it.

If you’re a non-UK trader and not registered for UK VAT you can arrange for an agent in the UK to import and supply goods on your behalf. The agent’s supply of services to you will be at the standard rate of VAT which you will not be able to reclaim. The agent will be able to recover the import VAT as input tax, if they are an agent acting as principal under Section 47 of the VAT Act.

If you use delayed declarations and are not registered for VAT, you will pay import VAT when you make your supplementary declaration. Find out more about delaying declarations.
