Pay at a branch by cash or cheque. You’ll need the payslip HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) sent with your bill.

Make your cheque payable to ‘HM Revenue and Customs only’.

Write your Class 3 National Insurance reference number on the back of your cheque. You’ll find the reference number on the payslip provided by HMRC.

HMRC will accept your payment on the date you make it, and not the date it reaches HMRC’s account, if you pay between Monday and Friday.
