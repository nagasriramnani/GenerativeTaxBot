Before you start

To check your Income Tax, you’ll need to sign in to your personal tax account using your Government Gateway user ID and password.

If you do not have a personal tax account

You need a Government Gateway user ID and password to set up a personal tax account. If you do not already have a user ID you can create one when you sign in for the first time.

You’ll need your National Insurance number or postcode and 2 of the following:

a valid UK passport

a UK photocard driving licence issued by the DVLA (or DVA in Northern Ireland)

a payslip from the last 3 months or a P60 from your employer for the last tax year

details of a tax credit claim if you made one

details from a Self Assessment tax return (in the last 2 years) if you made one
