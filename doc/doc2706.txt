Energy saving, heating and security

You can charge the reduced rate of VAT on work you do to install qualifying energy-saving products, and certain grant-funded heating and security equipment for people over 60 or on benefits.

You can also charge the reduced rate for extra work you need to do as part of the installation. But you must charge the standard rate of 20% on all work if the installation is just part of another, bigger job.

Example
You have to cut a new hatch in the ceiling to install loft insulation. Because you needed to do this as part of the insulation, you can charge reduced-rate VAT.
