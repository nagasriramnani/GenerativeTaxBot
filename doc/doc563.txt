In Scotland, if land or property was owned jointly with others (excluding a spouse or civil partner), take £4,000 off the value of the whole asset before working out the deceased’s share.

Example

The deceased owned a property in Scotland as a joint owner with 3 other people. The property is worth £200,000 on the date they died.

After £4,000 is taken away from the total value of the property, this leaves £196,000 (£200,000 - £4,000).

When divided by the number of owners, the deceased’s share of the property is £49,000 (£196,000 divided by 4).
