When tax is not due or is already deducted

Non-residents do not usually pay UK tax on:

the State Pension

interest from UK government securities (‘gilts’)

If you live abroad and are employed in the UK, your tax is calculated automatically on the days you work in the UK.

Income Tax is no longer automatically taken from interest on savings and investments.

When to report your income to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)

You usually have to send a Self Assessment tax return if:

you rent out property in the UK

you work for yourself in the UK

you have a pension outside the UK and you were UK resident in one of the 5 previous tax years

you have other untaxed income

You do not need to report your income to HMRC if you’ve already claimed tax relief under a ‘double-taxation agreement’.
