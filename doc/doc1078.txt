You can also charge a business a fixed sum for the cost of recovering a late commercial payment on top of claiming interest from it.

The amount you’re allowed to charge depends on the amount of debt. You can only charge the business once for each payment.

£1,000 to £9,999.99

These amounts are set by late payment legislation.

If you’re a supplier, you can also claim for reasonable costs each time you try to recover the debt.
