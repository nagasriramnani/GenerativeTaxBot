Payments on account

Payments on account

‘Payments on account’ are advance payments towards your tax bill (including Class 4 National Insurance if you’re self-employed).

You have to make 2 payments on account every year unless:

your last Self Assessment tax bill was less than £1,000

you paid more than 80% of the previous year’s tax you owed, for example through your tax code or because your bank had already deducted interest on your savings

Each payment is half your previous year’s tax bill. Payments are usually due by midnight on 31 January and 31 July.
