Getting a financial agreement

When you divorce or end a civil partnership you and your ex-partner need to agree how to separate your finances.

This includes deciding how you’re going to divide:

pensions

property

savings

investments

You might get things like:

a share of your your partner’s pension - including State Pension or private pension plans

regular maintenance payments to help with children or living expenses

You can usually avoid going to court hearings if you agree how to split your money and property.
