You cannot claim this relief if the UK’s double-taxation agreement requires you to claim tax back from the country your income was from.

Capital Gains Tax

You’ll usually pay tax in the country where you’re resident and be exempt from tax in the country where you make the capital gain. You will not usually need to make a claim.

You have to pay Capital Gains Tax on UK residential property even if you’re not UK resident.

When to claim relief

There are different rules if your gain comes from an asset that either:

cannot be taken out of the country, such as land or a house

you’re using for business in that country

You’ll need to pay tax in both countries and get relief from the UK.
