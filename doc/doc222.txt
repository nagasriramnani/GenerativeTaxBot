Debt Relief Orders

Debt Relief Orders (DROs) are one way to deal with your debts if you owe less than £30,000, do not have much spare income and do not own your home.

If you get one:

your creditors cannot recover their money without the court’s permission

you’re usually freed (‘discharged’) from your debts after 12 months

Get a Debt Relief Order

You get a DRO from the official receiver, an officer of the bankruptcy court, but you must apply through an authorised debt adviser. They’ll help you fill in the paperwork.
