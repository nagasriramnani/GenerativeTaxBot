Apportionment Scheme - you buy goods for resale

Direct Calculation Scheme - you make a small proportion of sales at one VAT rate and the majority at another rate

If your turnover excluding VAT is over £130 million you must agree a bespoke retail scheme with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

You can use a retail scheme together with the  Cash Accounting Scheme and the Annual Accounting Scheme.

You can’t use retail schemes with the Flat Rate Scheme.

Joining and using a scheme

You can join a retail scheme at the beginning of any VAT period. You don’t need to tell HMRC.

It’s up to you which scheme you join. The calculations you have to do vary for each scheme.

You must provide an individual VAT invoice if a customer asks for one.
