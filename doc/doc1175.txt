Tell HMRC about the power of attorney

Once they have a registered power of attorney, the person helping you will need to tell HMRC so they can update their records.

To do this, they need to send HMRC either an original or certified copy of the power of attorney.

Find out how to certify a copy of an LPA or how to certify other types of power of attorney.

If they’re in the UK and you want them to manage your tax credits, they can send the original or certified copy to:

IAA Team 2, Area E
St Mark’s House
St Mary’s Street

PR1 4AT

If they’re in the UK and you want them to manage any other tax affairs, they can send the original or certified copy to:
