This means you cannot:

borrow more than £500 without telling the lender about your DRO

act as the director of a company

create, manage or promote a company without the court’s permission

manage a business without telling those you do business with about your DRO

If you want to open a bank account, you may also have to tell the bank or building society about your DRO.

Check the Individual Insolvency Register to see when the restrictions end.

The restrictions usually last 12 months. They can be extended if careless or dishonest behaviour caused your debt problem. For example, you lied to get credit.
