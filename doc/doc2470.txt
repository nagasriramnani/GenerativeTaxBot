Business Asset Rollover Relief

You may be able to delay paying Capital Gains Tax if you:

sell (or ‘dispose of’) some business assets

use all or part of the proceeds to buy new assets

Business Asset Rollover Relief means you will not pay any tax until you sell the new asset. You may then need to pay tax on the gain from the original asset.

You can also claim:

provisional relief if you’re planning to buy new assets with your proceeds but have not done yet

relief if you use the proceeds to improve assets you already own
