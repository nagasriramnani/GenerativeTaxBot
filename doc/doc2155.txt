Tax if you leave the UK to live abroad

You must tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you’re either:

leaving the UK to live abroad permanently

going to work abroad full-time for at least one full tax year

The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the next year.

You do not need to tell HMRC if you’re leaving the UK for holidays or business trips.

How to tell HMRC

How to tell HMRC depends on whether you fill in a tax return or not. It also depends on your employment status.
