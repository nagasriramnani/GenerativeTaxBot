VAT-exclusive prices

To work out a price that excludes the standard rate of VAT (20%) divide the price including VAT by 1.2.

Example

You bought a table and the total price including 20% VAT was £180.

180 ÷ 1.20 = 150

The price excluding VAT is £150. The amount you can claim back is the difference between the two numbers - £30.

To work out a price that excludes the reduced rate of VAT (5%) divide the price including VAT by 1.05.

Example

You bought a stairlift and the total price including 5% VAT was £483.

483 ÷ 1.05 = 460

The price excluding VAT is £460. The amount you can claim back is the difference between the two numbers - £23.
