outside the EU to Northern Ireland

You can reclaim the VAT on your next VAT Return.

If you are bringing a vehicle from the EU into Northern Ireland, account for it as an ‘acquisition’ on your next VAT Return.

Vehicles you do not sell

You can reclaim VAT on vehicles you use for:

daily rental to customers

test drives

courtesy cars for your business

You have to pay VAT back to HMRC if a vehicle is also used privately, for example if an employee uses a car at weekends. To work out how much VAT to pay, read section 25 (‘Agreement with the Retail Motor Industry Federation’) of VAT Notice 700/57.

Stocking cars you do not own

You can also reclaim VAT on charges for stocking cars you do not own before you sell them.

Charging VAT

Work out what VAT to charge when you sell a vehicle.
