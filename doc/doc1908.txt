Work out your residence status

Whether you’re UK resident usually depends on how many days you spend in the UK in the tax year (6 April to 5 April the following year).

You’ll only be resident in the UK if both of the following apply:

you meet one or more of the automatic UK tests or the sufficient ties test

you do not meet any of the automatic overseas tests

Otherwise, you’ll be non-resident in the UK for tax purposes.

UK tests

You may be resident under the automatic UK tests if:

you spent 183 or more days in the UK in the tax year

your only home was in the UK for 91 days or more in a row - and you visited or stayed in it for at least 30 days of the tax year
