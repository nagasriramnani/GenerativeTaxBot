Complain about a claims company

Contact your claims company, the Financial Ombudsman Service, or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to make a complaint.

Claims management companies can help you make certain types of claims against financial services providers for a fee, such as claiming for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). They can give you advice on what you can claim and help you with the legal process.

Complaining about poor service

Complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you’re unhappy with the service you’ve received from a claims company, for example the results of your claim or the fees they’ve charged you.

Ask the claims company for a copy of their complaints procedure or check their website.
