Nominating a home

If you nominate a property as your main home you qualify for relief for most of the time you live away. You must have lived in the home as your only or main residence at some point while you owned it.

The rules are different if youâ€™re not UK resident for tax.

You cannot get relief for another property for the time your home is nominated, apart from for certain periods that always qualify for relief.
