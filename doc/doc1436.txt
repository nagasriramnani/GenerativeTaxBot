Buy a dissolved company's assets

You may be able to claim or buy an asset belonging to a dissolved company by asking the body representing the Crown. This is known as ‘referring’ an asset.

Who you ask depends on where the company was registered.

Anybody can refer an asset, for example if:

you’re the leaseholder of a property where the company owned the freehold

you want to buy or are affected by land owned by the company

you want to buy other assets of the company like shares, trade marks or copyrights

you’re a shareholder trying to get cash held by the company
