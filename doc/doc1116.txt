A judge will decide if you can take your case to a higher tribunal, called the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery). Appeal to the Upper Tribunal if you get permission.

If youâ€™re refused permission to appeal

You can apply to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal if the First-tier Tribunal refuses, or only gives you permission to appeal on limited grounds.
