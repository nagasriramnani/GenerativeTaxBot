work as an insolvency practitioner (an authorised debt specialist)

It’s a criminal offence to break the restrictions - you might be prosecuted if you do.

You must co-operate with the people managing your bankruptcy, for example by providing them with the information they ask for.

How long the restrictions last

Restrictions last until your bankruptcy ends. This will happen sooner if you cancel your bankruptcy.

When the restrictions can be extended

Bankruptcy restrictions can be extended if you do not carry out your duties under the bankruptcy proceedings or if you’re found to have acted carelessly or dishonestly.

The official receiver will tell you if the restrictions will be extended.
