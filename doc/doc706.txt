Settlor-interested trusts

These are where the settlor or their spouse or civil partner benefits from the trust. The trust could be:

an interest in possession trust

an accumulation trust

a discretionary trust

Example

You can no longer work due to illness. You set up a discretionary trust to make sure you have money in the future.

Youâ€™re the settlor - you may also benefit from the trust because the trustees can make payments to you.

Non-resident trusts

This is a trust where the trustees are not resident in the UK for tax purposes. The tax rules for non-resident trusts are very complicated.
