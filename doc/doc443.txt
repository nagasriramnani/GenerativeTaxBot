Keep proof

Types of proof include:

all receipts for goods and stock

bank statements, chequebook stubs

sales invoices, till rolls and bank slips

If you’re using traditional accounting

As well as the standard records, you’ll also need to keep further records so that your tax return includes:

what you’re owed but have not received yet

what you’ve committed to spend but have not paid out yet, for example you’ve received an invoice but have not paid it yet

the value of stock and work in progress at the end of your accounting period

your year end bank balances

how much you’ve invested in the business in the year

how much money you’ve taken out for your own use
