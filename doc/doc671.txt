Changes in your VAT liability

We may adjust the amount of your payments on account if your total VAT liability goes up or down by 20% or more. We may also remove you from the arrangement if your total VAT liability falls below the threshold.

If you want us to look again at the amounts due or you think we should remove you from a payments on account arrangement, write to the payments on account team:

You must not adjust your payments until we tell you to in writing.
