P11D

Your employer might give you a copy of your P11D if they used it to tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) about your ‘benefits in kind’ (for example company cars or interest-free loans).

They do not have to do this, but they must tell you how much each benefit is worth.

You might not get a P11D if your employer takes the tax you owe on your benefits out of your pay.

Your employer will write to you to explain how this works.
