Sometimes the trustees ‘mandate’ income to the beneficiary. This means it goes to them directly instead of being passed through the trustees.

If this happens, the beneficiary needs to include this on their Self Assessment tax return and pay tax on it.

Bare trusts

If you’re the beneficiary of a bare trust you’re responsible for paying tax on income from it.

You need to tell HMRC about the income on a Self Assessment tax return.

If you do not usually send a tax return, you need to register for self-assessment by 5 October following the tax year you had the income.
