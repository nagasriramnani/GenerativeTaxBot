Lost PAYE forms

Whether you can get a copy or not depends on the type of form you have lost.

Lost P45

You cannot get a replacement P45.

Instead, your new employer may give you a ‘starter checklist’ or ask you for the relevant details about your finances to send to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

Lost P60

Ask your employer for a replacement P60.

If you cannot get a replacement from them, you can either:

use your personal tax account to view or print the information that was on the P60

contact HMRC and ask for the information that was on the P60

Lost P11D
