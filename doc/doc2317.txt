Make extra repayments

You can choose to make extra repayments towards your student loan. These are in addition to the repayments you must make when your income is over the threshold amount for your repayment plan. Thereâ€™s no penalty if you make extra repayments.

You cannot get a refund of any extra repayments you make. You should only make them if you think you can pay off the full balance before the loan term ends.

Before you make an extra repayment, check when your loan will be written off.
