use the assets in your business or personal company

You can usually get partial relief if you used the assets only partly for your business.

If you’re giving away shares

The shares must be in a company that’s either:

not listed on any recognised stock exchange

your personal company

The company’s main activities must be in trading, for example providing goods or services, rather than non-trading activities like investment.

Working out the relief

You do not pay Capital Gains Tax on any assets you give away.

You might need to pay tax if you:

sell an asset for less than it’s worth to help the buyer

make a gain on what you paid for it
