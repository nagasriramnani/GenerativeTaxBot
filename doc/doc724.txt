Overview

You do not usually owe any tax on an inheritance at the time you inherit it.

Inheritance Tax

The personal representative (an executor or administrator) for the estate usually pays any Inheritance Tax due before giving you the inheritance.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will contact you if you have to pay any Inheritance Tax yourself. This may happen if:

the person who died gave you a gift in the 7 years before they died

your inheritance is put into a trust and the trust does not  or cannot pay

the personal representative could not or did not pay before you got your inheritance
