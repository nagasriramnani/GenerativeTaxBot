If your accounting period started on or after 1 January 2023

You’ll get separate penalties for submitting your return late and paying late.

If you submit your return late

For each VAT Return you send late, you’ll get a penalty point. This includes nil returns (where you have nothing to declare).

Once you reach your penalty point threshold, you’ll get a £200 penalty. The threshold is set by your accounting period (if you pay monthly, quarterly or annually).

You’ll get a further £200 penalty for each subsequent late submission while you’re at the threshold.
