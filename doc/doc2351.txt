For other conversions builders can charge a reduced VAT rate.

non-business - you cannot charge a fee for the use of the building

charitable, for example a hospice

residential, for example a children’s home

Building materials

You may claim a VAT refund for building materials that are part of the building and cannot be removed without tools or damaging the building.

What does not qualify

You cannot get a VAT refund for:

building projects in the Channel Islands

materials or services that do not have any VAT - for example, they were zero-rated or exempt
