Use your payroll software to recalculate their National Insurance, either at the time of the change or the end of the tax year.

When an employee stops being a director

After you’ve paid the employee for the last time, tell HMRC by deleting the ‘Director’s NIC calculation method’ entry in the FPS.

Work out any National Insurance due using payroll software. Deduct any National Insurance the director owes from their last payment.

If the director is still your employee

Calculate their National Insurance based on their earnings for the whole of the tax year, as if they were still a director.

From the next tax year, calculate their National Insurance as an employee based on each pay period.
