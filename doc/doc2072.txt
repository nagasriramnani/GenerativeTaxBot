Example

You and your partner run a bed and breakfast and live there the entire year. Your overall business premises expenses are £15,000.

Calculation:

Flat rate: 12 months x £500 per month = £6,000

You can claim: 
£15,000 - £6,000 = £9,000

If someone lives at your business premises for part of the year, you can deduct only the relevant flat rate for the months they live there.

Example

You and your partner run a bed and breakfast and live there the entire year. Your child is at university for 9 months a year but comes back to live at home for 3 months in the summer.

Calculation:

Flat rate: 9 months x £500 per month = £4,500
Flat rate: 3 months x £650 per month = £1,950 
Total = £6,450

You can claim: 
£15,000 - £6,450 = £8,550
