Overview

You’ll get a bill when you’ve filed your tax return. If you filed online you can view this:

when you’ve finished filling in your return (but before you submit it) - in the section ‘View your calculation’

in your final tax calculation - it can take up to 72 hours after you’ve submitted your return for this to be available in your account

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will send your bill by post if you did a paper return.

You may need your tax calculation (known as a ‘SA302’), for example if you’re self-employed and applying for a mortgage.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
