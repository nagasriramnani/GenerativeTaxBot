Capital Gains Tax

You only pay Capital Gains Tax if you make a gain on UK property or land. You do not pay it on other UK assets, such as UK shares. You will not usually need to make a claim for assets you do not pay tax on - but you should check the relevant double taxation agreement.

If you return to the UK after being non-resident, you may have to pay tax on any assets you owned before you left the UK - even if you’ve paid tax on any gains in the country you moved to. You can usually claim double-taxation relief.
