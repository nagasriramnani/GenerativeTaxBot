The Probate Call Centre cannot help with disagreements between executors. You’ll need to find another way to reach an agreement - this could mean getting legal advice.

If you do not want to be an executor

You can give up your right to apply for probate or appoint someone else to apply for you.

Keep the right to apply later

If more than one executor is named in the will, you can choose not to apply now but reserve the right to apply later. This is known as holding ‘power reserved’.
