If you do not have an appeal form

You can send a signed letter to HMRC instead. You must include a full explanation of why your return or payment was late, including dates.

Also include in your letter:

your name

your reference number - for example your Self Assessment Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) or VAT registration number

If you could not file or pay because of computer problems, you should include the following:

the date you tried to file or pay online

details of any system error message

Send your claim to the HMRC office related to your return.

Deadlines

You usually have 30 days from the date your penalty was issued to appeal.

If you miss this deadline you must explain the reason for the delay so that HMRC can decide if theyâ€™ll consider your appeal.
