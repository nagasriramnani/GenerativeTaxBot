How to apply

To get a National Insurance number you need to apply online. You’ll need to prove your identity when you apply.

What documents you’ll need

If you have any of the following documents, get them ready before you start:

a passport from any country

a biometric residence permit (BRP)

a national identity card from an EU country or from Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland

You might need to enter information from one or more of these documents.

You can still apply if you do not have any of these documents, but you may need to attend an appointment in person to prove your identity.
