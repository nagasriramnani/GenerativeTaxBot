Margin on sale (sales price less purchase price)

VAT due (16.67% or one-sixth)

You must keep VAT records for 6 years. You have to keep records until you sell the item for any stock you bought more than 6 years ago that you plan to sell under the margin scheme.

Invoices

To use the margin scheme, you must have invoices for each item that meet the VAT margin scheme requirements.

The margin scheme invoice requirements are not the same as the general VAT invoice requirements.

You must have:

an invoice from the seller when you bought the item

a copy of the invoice you gave to the buyer when you sold the item

Buying

When you buy something you plan to sell under a margin scheme, you must get an invoice from the seller that includes:

date

sellerâ€™s name and address
