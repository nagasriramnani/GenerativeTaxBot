Transferring any unused residence nil rate band

Any residence nil rate band (RNRB) that’s not used when someone dies can go to their spouse or civil partner’s estate when they die. This transfer can also happen if the first of the couple died before 6 April 2017, even though the residence nil rate band was not available at that time.
