You may not get a refund if you have tax due in the next 35 days (for example for a payment on account). Instead, the money will be deducted from the tax you owe.

If you need to pay more tax

Your updated bill will also show:

the deadline for paying

the effect on any payments on account you need to make

If you sent an updated paper return

HMRC will usually send you an updated bill within 4 weeks.

It’s taking longer than usual to process changes. You can check when you can expect a reply from HMRC.

They’ll pay any refund directly into your bank account, as long as you include your bank details on your tax return.
