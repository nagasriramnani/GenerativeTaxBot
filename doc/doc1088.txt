Other VAT schemes

There are other VAT schemes you may be able to join depending on your VAT taxable turnover and type of business.

If your annual VAT taxable turnover is Â£1.35 million or less, you may be eligible for the:

VAT Annual Accounting Scheme - complete one VAT return each year instead of 4

VAT Cash Accounting Scheme - pay VAT to HMRC when your customer pays you rather than when you invoice them

If you are a retail business or sell second-hand goods, you may be able to use:

a VAT margin scheme - pay VAT on the value you add to the goods you sell rather than on the full selling price of each item

one of 3 VAT retail schemes - calculate the VAT once with each VAT return rather than calculating it for each sale you make
