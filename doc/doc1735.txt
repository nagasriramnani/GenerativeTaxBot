If you cannot pay your tax bill in full, you may be able to set up a payment plan to pay it in instalments. This is called a ‘Time to Pay’ arrangement.

You will not be able to set up a payment plan if HMRC does not think you will keep up with the repayments. If HMRC cannot agree a payment plan with you, they’ll ask you to pay the amount you owe in full.
