Individual Voluntary Arrangements

An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is an agreement with your creditors to pay all or part of your debts. You agree to make regular payments to an insolvency practitioner, who will divide this money between your creditors.

An IVA can give you more control of your assets than bankruptcy.

MoneyHelper has information on organisations that can give you free advice about whether an IVA is right for you.
