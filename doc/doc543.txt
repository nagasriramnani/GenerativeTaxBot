The 3 grandchildren do not want to keep the property jointly. The estate’s personal representative sells the property and distributes the sale proceeds between the 3 grandchildren.

As the home passes to the grandchildren under the terms of Jocelyn’s will, the residence nil rate band of £150,000 will be available.

The direct descendants can also inherit the home if it’s left to them as a result of amending the will by a deed of variation. The deed of variation replaces the terms of a will, so the outcome of the deed is considered, rather than the wording of the will.

What happens if the home is in a trust

A home, or a share of one could be either:

held in a trust before a person dies

transferred to a trust when they die
