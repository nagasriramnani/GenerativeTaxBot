Gender change

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is usually told automatically when you change gender legally by applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate.

Tell your employer at the same time - they must update your payroll records and National Insurance contributions.

HMRC will:

update its records with your gender and any name change

tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)

restrict your records so only specialist staff at HMRC and DWP can access them

hand your tax affairs to HMRCâ€™s Public Department 1
