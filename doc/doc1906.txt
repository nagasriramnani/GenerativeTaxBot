a ‘tax credit’ - this is one-ninth of the dividend

Work out the tax you owe by multiplying the dividend amount by the effective tax rate. Ignore the tax credit.

How you pay tax

If you need to send a tax return, fill in the ‘Dividends’ section in your return. If you do not need to send one, contact the helpline.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will tell you what you owe based on what you report and the dividend tax rates.
