If HMRC needs to contact you about anything confidential they’ll reply by phone or post.

Ask HMRC Online

Ask HMRC’s digital assistant to get a quick answer to your query about VAT.

If the digital assistant cannot help you, you can ask to transfer to an HMRC adviser if they’re available.

Phone

Only call HMRC if your VAT or Fulfilment House Due Diligence Scheme (FHDDS) enquiry is urgent. Please have your postcode, FHDDS and VAT registration number if you need to call.

You cannot pay, or agree time to pay using this phone number. Find out what to do if you cannot pay your tax bill on time.

You can also use Relay UK if you cannot hear or speak on the phone: dial 18001 then 0300 200 3700.
