What you need to do

Tell your employer - they’ll fill in part 2 of your ‘certificate of election’ and give it back to you. Fill in part 1 and send it back to HMRC.

If you’re self-employed, register to pay Class 2 National Insurance straight away. Fill in part 1 of your certificate of election and send it back to HMRC.

Start paying the reduced rate

You must already be opted into the scheme.

Give your ‘certificate of election’ - form CA4139, CF383 or CF380A - to your employer if you want to claim your entitlement to pay the reduced rate.

If you opted in but do not have your certificate, you can apply for a new one by sending HMRC either:

form CF9 (if you’re married)

form CF9A (if you’re a widow)
