When youâ€™ve paid off the debt

Change how much you pay

You can apply to get the payments reduced if you cannot afford them. Download and fill in form N244 and send it to the court that issued the court order.

You have to do this within 14 days of getting the order.

You can also apply if the order has been in place for some time and your circumstances change.

Pay off the debt more quickly

Speak to the person or company you owe the money to if you want to pay more. They might either:

take extra payments directly

agree to put the order on hold so you can pay more directly to them
