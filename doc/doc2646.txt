You cannot get a refund of any extra repayments you make. You should only make them if you think you can pay off the full balance before the loan term ends.

Before you make an extra repayment, check when your loan will be written off.

You should speak to a financial adviser if youâ€™re unsure whether you should make extra repayments or not.

If you decide to make an extra repayment, you can choose how it is applied to your loan. For example, you can use it to reduce the total balance of your loan or to reduce the balance of a specific plan (if you have more than one plan).
