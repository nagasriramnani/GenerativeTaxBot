Basic rate Income Tax payers

If you’re a basic rate taxpayer, you need to work out the tax rate you’ll pay on gains that are not eligible for Business Asset Disposal Relief.

Work out how much taxable income you have - deduct your Personal Allowance and any other Income Tax reliefs you’re entitled to.
