You can get temporary protection from your creditors through the ‘Breathing Space’ scheme, while still making repayments. You’ll need to apply through a debt adviser.

If you’re threatened with bailiffs

The person or business you owe money to may use bailiffs to collect the money.

They’ll have to apply to the court for a ‘warrant’, which will give the bailiff the right to visit your home or property. You’ll be given 7 days to pay before they visit.

You may be able to stop the bailiff from visiting, by filling in the N245 application form.

Say on the form how you’ll repay the money - for example weekly or monthly payments. If your offer is accepted, the warrant will be stopped as long as you keep up with the payments.
