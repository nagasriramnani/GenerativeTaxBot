When cash basis might not suit your business

Cash basis probably will not suit you if you:

want to claim interest or bank charges of more than £500 as an expense

run a business that’s more complex, for example you have high levels of stock

need to get finance for your business - a bank could ask to see accounts drawn up using traditional accounting to see what you owe and are due before agreeing a loan

have losses that you want to offset against other taxable income (‘sideways loss relief’)

Talk to a tax professional (such as an accountant) or legal adviser if you need help.

Find out if you’re eligible to use cash basis.
