Reasonable excuses

You can appeal against some penalties if you have a reasonable excuse, for example for your return or payment being late.

What may count as a reasonable excuse

A reasonable excuse is something that stopped you meeting a tax obligation that you took reasonable care to meet, for example:

your partner or another close relative died shortly before the tax return or payment deadline

you had an unexpected stay in hospital that prevented you from dealing with your tax affairs

you had a serious or life-threatening illness
