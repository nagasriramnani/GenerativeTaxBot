Community amateur sports clubs do not qualify for VAT reliefs for charities.

Check the charity is eligible

Ask the charity to provide you with evidence that they’re a charity. This can be either:

their Charity Commission registration number

a letter of recognition from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if they’re not registered with the Charity Commission (for example if they’re a charity in Scotland or Northern Ireland)

Get a written declaration

You also need to ask the charity to give you a written declaration or certificate confirming it meets the conditions for the particular VAT relief.

Charities must follow a particular format for the declaration or certificate. The declaration must be separate from the order form or invoice.
