The pool ends when you sell the asset. This means you can claim the capital allowances over a shorter period.

Move the balance into your main pool in your next accounting period or tax year if you’re still using the item after 8 years.

Let HMRC know

Let HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) know on your tax return if you’re a limited company and you decide to create a short life asset pool. You must do this within 2 years of the end of the tax year when you bought the item.

Let HMRC know in writing if you’re a sole trader or in a partnership - include how much the item cost and when you acquired it. The deadline is the online filing deadline (31 January) for the tax year after the one you bought the item in.
