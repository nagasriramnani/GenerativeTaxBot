Timing, labour and materials

Work that’s zero-rated for VAT must take place during the construction project, or be closely related to it (eg demolishing existing buildings and preparing the site). This is known as work done ‘in the course of construction’.

You cannot zero-rate work you do after a building’s finished, apart from correcting defects in the original work (‘snagging’).

All labour on a qualifying building can be zero-rated, but there are special rules on what counts as building materials for VAT purposes.
