If your right to live in the UK depends on your relationship with someone who died you might need to apply for a new visa.

              Check the rules if:

              
you're in the UK as the partner of a British Citizen or someone with indefinite leave to remain 
your partner who died served as a member of HM Forces 


              Contact UKVI to check the rules for other visas

Step 5:
                  
                
              

              
                Value the estate and check if you need to pay Inheritance Tax
              
          


          
              To find out if there’s Inheritance Tax to pay, you need to estimate the value of the property, money and possessions (the ‘estate’) of the person who died.
