If the person had a mortgage

Ask the mortgage lender if they require payments to continue while you’re applying for probate. If they do, you need to either:

pay these bills yourself - and reclaim them from the estate once you’ve got probate

check if the person had a life assurance or mortgage protection policy that covers these payments
