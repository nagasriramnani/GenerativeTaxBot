Debt Management Plans

A Debt Management Plan is an agreement between you and your creditors to pay all of your debts.

Debt management plans are usually used when either:

you can only afford to pay creditors a small amount each month

you have debt problems but will be able to make repayments in a few months

You can arrange a plan with your creditors yourself or through a licensed debt management company for a fee. If you arrange this with a company:

you make regular payments to the company

the company shares the money out between your creditors
