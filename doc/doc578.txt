If you have £1,000 or less in your pool

You can claim the full amount if the balance in your main or special rate pool is £1,000 or less before you work out your allowance.

This is called a small pools allowance. It does not apply to single asset pools. You can either claim a small pools allowance or writing down allowances - you cannot claim both.

This amount is adjusted if your accounting period is more or less than 12 months.

For example, if your accounting period is 9 months the limit will be 9/12 x £1,000 = £750.
