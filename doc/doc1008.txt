Events

The place of supply of admission to an event is where the event takes place, wherever the customer or supplier is located. These include such services as:

entertainment and cultural performances - including sports events

the right to attend exhibitions, conferences, meetings or seminars

ancillary services, such as payments for cloakrooms or similar facilities

If the customer is a non-business customer then most supplies relating to events are subject to VAT where theyâ€™re carried out. This includes all services connected to cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific and educational events, or entertainment.
