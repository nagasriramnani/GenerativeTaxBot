Work out your gain

You may need to pay tax when you sell your home if you do not qualify for full Private Residence Relief.

If you have tax to pay you need to work out how much gain you made when you sold your home.

Your gain is usually the difference between what you paid for your home and what you sold it for. Use the market value instead if:

it was a gift (there are different rules if it was to your spouse, civil partner or a charity)

you sold it for less than it was worth to help the buyer

you inherited the asset (and do not know the Inheritance Tax value)

you owned it before April 1982
