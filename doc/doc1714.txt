Approve a payment through your online bank account

You can pay your VAT bill directly using your online or mobile bank account.

When you’re ready to pay, start your VAT payment. Select the ‘pay by bank account’ option. You’ll then be directed to sign in to your online or mobile banking account to approve your VAT payment.

The payment is usually instant but sometimes it takes up to 2 hours to show in your account.

You’ll need to have your online banking details ready to pay this way.
