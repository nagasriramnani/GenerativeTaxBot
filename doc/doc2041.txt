People that have made their permanent home in the UK (for example, they are domiciled in the UK) are subject to Inheritance Tax on their worldwide assets so it does not matter where the home is. People who are not domiciled in the UK are only subject to Inheritance Tax on their assets in the UK, so the home must be in the UK to be within the scope of Inheritance Tax and within their estate when they die. In these cases, the home will only qualify for the residence nil rate band if itâ€™s in the UK.

Work out the value of the home

To work out the value of the home, use the open market value of the home, less any debts such as a mortgage.

If the person who died only owned a share of the home, only include what their share was worth.
