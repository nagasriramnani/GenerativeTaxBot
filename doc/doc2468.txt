If you work full-time abroad, you can usually visit the UK for up to 90 days - as long as you work no more than 30 of these days.

You might become a UK resident again if you start new activities in the UK after you’ve left, for example you get involved in a business or buy a new property.

Check your residence status if you’re not sure how your activities in the UK affect your status.
