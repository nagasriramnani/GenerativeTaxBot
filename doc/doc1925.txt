Skip to contents of guide

Contents

If you’ve not paid the right amount of tax

If your tax calculation letter (P800) says you’re due a refund

If your tax calculation letter (P800) says you owe tax

If your tax calculation letter (P800) says you owe tax

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will collect the tax you owe over the next year. This will happen automatically if you:

pay Income Tax through an employer or pension provider

earn enough income over your Personal Allowance to cover the underpayment

owe less than £3,000

HMRC will write to you about how you can pay if they cannot collect the money this way.
