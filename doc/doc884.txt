What you pay it on

You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you make a profit (‘gain’) when you sell (or ‘dispose of’) all or part of a business asset.

Business assets you may need to pay tax on include:

land and buildings

fixtures and fittings

plant and machinery, for example a digger

shares

registered trademarks

your business’s reputation

You’ll need to work out your gain to find out whether you need to pay tax.

You pay Capital Gains Tax if you’re a self-employed sole trader or in a business partnership. Other organisations like limited companies pay Corporation Tax on profits from selling their assets.
