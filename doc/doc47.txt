VAT on discounts and gifts

There are different rules for charging VAT on discounts, gifts and free services.

Charging VAT on discounts

For basic discounts (for example, a 20% off discount), charge VAT on the discounted price.

Multi-buy offers

Multi-buy offers are where the customer gets a discount for buying more items, for example 3 items for £20.

For multi-buy offers where all the items have the same VAT rate (usually standard rate), charge VAT on the combined price.

If the items in the offer have different rates of VAT, you need to use a method called ‘apportionment’.
