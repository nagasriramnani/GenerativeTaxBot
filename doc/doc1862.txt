Capital allowances when you sell an asset

When you sell or ‘dispose of’ something you claimed capital allowances on, include the value in your calculations for the accounting period you sell it in.

You do not need to do this if you give it to a charity or community amateur sports club (CASC).

Dispose of an asset

You dispose of an asset if you:

sell it

give it away as a gift or transfer it to someone else

swap it for something else

get compensation for it - like an insurance payout if it’s been lost or destroyed

use it for anything other than your business

close your business

Work out the value

The value is usually how much you sold it for.

Use the market value (the amount you’d expect to sell it for) if you:

gave it away

kept it to use for something other than your business
