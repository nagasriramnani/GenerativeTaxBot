Direct Debit

You can only use Direct Debit to make voluntary Class 3 National Insurance contributions for the current tax year (6 April 2023 to 5 April 2024).

To set up monthly payments, download and send the Direct Debit form to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The address is on the form.

HMRC will write within 21 days to confirm your Direct Debit is set up.

Payments appear on your statement as ‘HMRC NI-DD’.
