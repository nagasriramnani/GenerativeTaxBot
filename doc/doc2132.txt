When you pay a surcharge

You do not pay a surcharge the first time you default.

If you default again within 12 months, the surcharge period is extended for another 12 months. You may also have to pay extra on top of the VAT you owe.

HMRC will write to you explaining any surcharges you owe.

If you submit a late return, you will not have to pay a surcharge if you:

pay your VAT in full by the deadline

have no tax to pay

are due a VAT repayment

How much you pay

The surcharge is a percentage of the outstanding VAT for the period in default. It’s calculated on the due date.

This table shows how much you’ll be charged if you default within a surcharge period.
