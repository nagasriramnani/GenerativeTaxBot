you are employed

you get a pension

If you’re registered for Self Assessment, your bill will be adjusted automatically if you’ve underpaid or overpaid tax. You will not get a tax calculation letter or a Simple Assessment letter.

When letters are sent

The letters are sent out between June and the end of November.

Why you might get a tax calculation letter

You might get a tax calculation letter if you either owe tax or are owed a refund because you:

were put on the wrong tax code, for example because HMRC had the wrong information about your income

finished one job, started a new one and were paid by both in the same month

started receiving a pension at work

received Employment and Support Allowance or Jobseeker’s Allowance
