Get help working out your residence status

If you’re still unsure about your status, you can use the residence status checker. This will give you an indication of whether you were a UK resident in any tax year from 6 April 2016.

You may be asked for the following information about the year you’re checking:

how many days you spent living and working in the UK and abroad

roughly how many hours a week you worked

family you have in the UK

details of your home in the UK
