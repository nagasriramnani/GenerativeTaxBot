You’ll continue paying Class 4 contributions until the end of the tax year in which you reach State Pension age.

For example, you reach State Pension age on 6 September 2023. You’ll stop making Class 4 contributions on 5 April 2024 and pay your final Class 4 bill by 31 January 2025, together with your Income Tax.

If you’re self employed, you still need to send a Self Assessment tax return for each year you work - even after you reach State Pension age.

You can claim back National Insurance if you’ve overpaid.

If you continue working

Show your employer proof of your age (a birth certificate or passport, for example) to make sure you stop paying National Insurance.
