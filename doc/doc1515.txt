Apply for probate

You can apply for probate yourself online or by post. This can be cheaper than paying a probate practitioner (such as a solicitor) to apply for you.

Read guidance from Money Helper about using a probate practitioner for information on hiring a legal professional.

You’ll usually get probate within 16 weeks of submitting your application. It can take longer if you need to provide additional information.

This guide and the service are also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
