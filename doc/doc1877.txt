Great Britain to any destination outside the UK

Northern Ireland to a destination outside the UK and EU

Find out what you need to do if you are making sales of goods from Northern Ireland to the EU or see notice 725.

Goods dispatched by post

You can zero rate goods you send by post to an address outside the UK unless they are being sent from Northern Ireland to an EU country.
