Types of capital allowances for plant and machinery

You can claim different amounts, depending on which capital allowance you use.

The capital allowances (also known as plant and machinery allowances) are:

annual investment allowance (AIA) - you can claim up to £1 million on certain plant and machinery

100% first year allowances - you can claim the full amount for certain plant and machinery in the year that it was bought

the super-deduction or 50% special rate first year allowance - you can claim these for certain plant and machinery you buy from 1 April 2021 up to and including 31 March 2023

writing down allowances - you can claim these if your plant and machinery does not qualify for AIA or you’ve already claimed the maximum amount
