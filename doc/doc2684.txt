Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme)

If you live in England or Wales, you can get temporary protection from your creditors while you get debt advice and make a plan. This scheme is called ‘Breathing Space’.

You can get temporary protection for up to 60 days.

You’ll still need to make your debt repayments.

If you get it:

enforcement action cannot be taken against you

your creditors cannot contact you about debts included in your Breathing Space
