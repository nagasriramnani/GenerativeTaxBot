For example, you can give your child a wedding gift of £5,000 as well as £3,000 using your annual exemption in the same tax year.

If you make regular payments

You can make regular payments to help with another person’s living costs. There’s no limit to how much you can give tax free, as long as:

you can afford the payments after meeting your usual living costs

you pay from your regular monthly income

These are known as ‘normal expenditure out of income’. They include:

paying rent for your child

paying into a savings account for a child under 18

giving financial support to an elderly relative

If you’re giving gifts to the same person, you can combine ‘normal expenditure out of income’ with any other allowance, except for the small gift allowance.
