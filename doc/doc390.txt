Overview

You may have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge if you or your partner have an individual income that’s over £50,000 and either:

you or your partner get Child Benefit

someone else gets Child Benefit for a child living with you and they contribute at least an equal amount towards the child’s upkeep

It does not matter if the child living with you is not your own child.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).
