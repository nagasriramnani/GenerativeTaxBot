Work out your flat rate

Work out your flat rate

The VAT flat rate you use usually depends on your business type. You may pay a different rate if you only spend a small amount on goods.

You get a 1% discount if you’re in your first year as a VAT-registered business.

If you spend a small amount on goods

You’re classed as a ‘limited cost business’ if your goods cost less than either:

2% of your turnover

£1,000 a year (if your costs are more than 2%)

This means you pay a higher rate of 16.5%. You can calculate if you need to pay the higher rate and work out which goods count as costs.

If you are not a limited cost business, you use your business type to work out your flat rate.
