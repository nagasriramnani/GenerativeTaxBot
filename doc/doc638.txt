Overview

You may be able to pay Class 3 voluntary National Insurance to fill gaps in your contributions record to qualify for benefits like the State Pension.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Before you pay

Check your National Insurance record to find out:

if you have any gaps

if youâ€™re eligible to pay voluntary contributions

how much it will cost

Voluntary contributions do not always increase your State Pension.
