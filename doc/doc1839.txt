If you applied to Student Finance Northern Ireland

You’re on Plan 1, whether you studied an undergraduate course or a postgraduate course.

If you think you’re on the wrong plan

Check which plan you’re on by signing in to your online repayment account and downloading your ‘active plan type letter’. Then ask your employer which plan they have you on.

If it’s different from the plan in your letter, show this to your employer so they can update your payroll details. You can get a refund if you paid back too much of your loan because you were on the wrong plan type.
