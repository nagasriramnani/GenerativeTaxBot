Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or the social security authority in your country if you’re not sure if you should be paying National Insurance in the UK.

If you’re also taxed abroad

You may be taxed twice on the same income or gains unless the country you’ve come from has a double-taxation agreement with the UK.

If you’ve paid too much UK tax

Claim tax relief or a tax refund owed if you’re only working in the UK for a short time and plan to leave.

Apply to claim back tax if you’re a foreign national assigned to the UK and you think you’ve paid too much.
