How much do you pay

Each payment is either 10% of your estimated VAT bill (monthly payments) or 25% (quarterly payments). The amount is based on previous VAT returns (or estimated if you’re new to VAT).

HMRC will write telling you when your instalments are due and how much they’ll be.

The final payment (known as a ‘balancing payment’) is the difference between your advance payments and the actual VAT bill confirmed on your VAT Return.

You may be due a VAT refund if you’ve overpaid HMRC.

You must pay VAT to HMRC electronically, for example by Direct Debit or internet banking.
