If you started repaying before you needed to

If a deduction is taken from your salary before you’re due to start repaying, you can ask for a refund.

If your employer had you on the wrong repayment plan

You can get a refund if you’re on Plan 2 or Plan 4 but your employer had you on another plan. Check your employer has you on the correct repayment plan.
