If you take over a VAT-registered business

You must register for VAT if the combined taxable turnover of the new business and your existing business is over the threshold.

Calculate your turnover

Your turnover is the total value of everything you sell that is not exempt from VAT. It also includes:

zero-rated goods

goods you hired or loaned to customers

business goods used for personal reasons

goods you bartered, part-exchanged or gave as gifts

services you received from businesses in other countries that you had to ‘reverse charge’

building work over £100,000 your business did for itself
