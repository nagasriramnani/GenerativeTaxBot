HMRC will tell you:

the name and contact details of the person dealing with your complaint

which stage of the complaints process you’re at and what the next step is

After HMRC has reviewed your complaint, you’ll be told the outcome of the first tier review.

HMRC will not treat you any differently because you’ve made a complaint. They will handle your complaint fairly, confidentially and investigate the issues thoroughly.

HMRC will consider refunding any reasonable costs directly caused by their mistakes or delays. Costs can include:

postage

phone charges

professional fees

Keep your receipts if you want a refund.
