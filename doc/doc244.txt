£2,400 – £2,274 (your income minus the Plan 2 threshold) = £126
9% of £126 = £11

This means the amount you’d repay each month would be £50.

If you have more than one job

You’ll only make repayments from jobs where you’re paid over the threshold for your plan type, not your combined income.

Example

You have a Plan 1 loan and you have 2 jobs. Before tax and other deductions, you’re paid £1,000 a month from one job and £800 a month for the other.

You will not have to make repayments because neither salary is above the £1,834 a month threshold.

Example

You have a Plan 2 loan and you have 2 jobs. Before tax and other deductions, you’re paid £2,300 a month from one job and £500 a month for the other.
