Overview

You need to pay back:

Tuition Fee Loans

Maintenance Loans

Postgraduate Loans

You do not need to pay back other student finance, for example grants and bursaries, unless you’ve been paid too much. You still have to repay your student loan if you leave your course early.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

When you start repaying your loan and how much you pay depends on which repayment plan you’re on.
