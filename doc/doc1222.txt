Get help with tax

You can get help if you don’t understand something about your tax, for example tax returns, allowances and tax codes.

You can also get help and support with Self Assessment.

Get help from HMRC

For simple queries, you can contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). You should also contact them in the first instance if you:

can’t pay your tax bill on time

disagree with a tax decision

have additional needs, for example a disability or you don’t speak English

If you’re on a low income

If HMRC can’t help and you’re on a low income (up to about £380 a week), you may be able to get free professional advice. This includes help with filling in forms and what to do if you owe money to HMRC. Contact:

Tax Help for Older People if you’re over 60 and need help with personal tax
