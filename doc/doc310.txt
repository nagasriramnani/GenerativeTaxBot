Going to a court hearing

Resolve the claim through mediation

You’ll be offered mediation when you respond to the claim. It’s free and often quicker than going to court.

The claimant also needs to agree to mediation for it to take place. If both sides agree to mediation, you’ll be contacted to arrange an appointment.

A neutral mediator from HM Courts and Tribunals Service will speak to each side separately by phone to help you to explore options, negotiate and agree a settlement.
