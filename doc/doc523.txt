Complain to a court about a bailiff’s behaviour

If a bailiff has a certificate allowing them to carry out enforcement action (a certificated enforcement agent) you can ask the court to consider whether they should be allowed to continue operating. You need to:

fill out and submit an EAC2 form

send it to the court where the agent is registered - you can find this on the certificated enforcement register

The court can remove the agent’s certificate or order them to pay compensation.

It’s free to make a complaint, but you may have to pay legal costs if you complain to a court and they decide there were no ‘reasonable grounds’ for the complaint.
