make a gain on what you paid for it

Example

You sell a shop worth £81,000 to your brother for £40,000. It cost you £23,000. Include the £17,000 gain (£40,000 minus £23,000) when you’re working out your total taxable gain.

The person you give the asset to will need to include its cost when they work out the gain on the business assets or shares - if they sell them later.

How to claim

You must claim jointly with the person you give the gift to. Send your claim at the time you give them the gift.

Fill in the form in the relief for gifts and similar transactions helpsheet and include it with your Self Assessment tax return. If you send your tax return online, upload a scanned copy of the form.
