If the home, or the share of the home, was held in a trust before the person died or is transferred to a trust when they die, you may be able to claim the residence nil rate band depending on the type of trust. Find out about dealing with a trust when someone dies.

The home does not have to be in the UK but it does have to be within the scope of Inheritance Tax and it must be included in a person’s estate. This may depend on their domicile (where they’ve made their permanent home) and where the home is.
