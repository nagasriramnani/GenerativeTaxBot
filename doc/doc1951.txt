How to report disposals

For properties that are disposed of from 6 April 2020 you must report and pay using the Capital Gains Tax on UK property account. You will be able to report multiple disposals with the same completion date on one return.

When you report a disposal, you need to include a computation of your taxable gains and losses along with your return.

Trustees of non-UK resident trusts

Trustees of non-UK resident trusts that become liable to pay non-resident Capital Gains Tax, must be registered with HMRC before creating a Capital Gains Tax on UK property account. Find out more aboutÂ when and how to register a trust.
