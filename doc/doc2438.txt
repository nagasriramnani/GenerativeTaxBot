If your accounting period started on or before 31 December 2022

HMRC will record a ‘default’ on your account if you are late with your VAT Return or payment.

Once you’ve defaulted, you’ll begin a 12 month ‘surcharge period’. A surcharge is an extra amount on top of the VAT you owe.

When you pay a surcharge

You do not pay a surcharge the first time you default.

If you default again within 12 months, the surcharge period is extended for another 12 months. You may also have to pay extra on top of the VAT you owe.

HMRC will write to you explaining any surcharges you owe.

If you submit a late return, you will not have to pay a surcharge if you:

pay your VAT in full by the deadline
