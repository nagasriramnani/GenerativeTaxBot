Reduced rate National Insurance for married women

Until April 1977, married women could choose to pay a reduced rate of National Insurance (sometimes called the ‘small stamp’).

The reduced rate is 5.85% of your weekly earnings between £242 and £967 (instead of the standard rate of 12%) if you’re employed.

You might still be paying the reduced rate if you opted in before the scheme ended.

If you’re self-employed

You do not pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions if you opted in before the scheme ended.

How your benefits are affected if you’re opted in

Your State Pension will be reduced and you will not be able to claim some benefits.

You will not usually be entitled to benefits based on your National Insurance contributions.
