Defer your National Insurance

Employees with more than one job may be able to defer (delay) paying Class 1 National Insurance.

You can do this if any of the following apply:

you pay Class 1 National Insurance with more than one employer

you earn £967 or more per week from one job over the tax year

you earn £1,209 or more per week from 2 jobs over the tax year

You’ll usually pay a reduced rate of 2% on your weekly earnings between £242 and £967 in one of your jobs (instead of the standard rate of 12%).

If you’re self-employed

You cannot defer Class 4 contributions any more.

You may be able to claim a refund for previous tax years.

How to defer

Send form CA72A before:

14 February 2023 if you’re employed

31 January 2023 if you’re self-employed
