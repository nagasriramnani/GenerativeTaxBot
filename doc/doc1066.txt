Work out your gain

Your gain is usually the difference between what you paid for your business asset and what you sold it for.

Use the market value instead if:

you gave it away (there are different rules if it was to your spouse, civil partner or a charity)

you sold it for less than it was worth to help the buyer

you inherited the asset (and do not know the Inheritance Tax value)

you owned it before April 1982

If the asset was given to you and you claimed Gift Hold-Over Relief, use the amount it was originally bought for to work out your gain. If you paid less than it was worth, use the amount you paid for it.
