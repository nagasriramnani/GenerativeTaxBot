Check for other bankruptcy petitions

You must check if the debtor has had any bankruptcy petitions against them in the past 18 months. These checks are called ‘searches’.

Most petitions are presented in the area where the debtor lives. Government departments, including HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), present all petitions in London.

Check for petitions presented in London

Carry out checks using the public computers at either:

the Rolls Building of the Royal Courts of Justice

the Central London County Court

It costs £11 to use the computers for 15 minutes. You can pay by debit or credit card or with cash.
