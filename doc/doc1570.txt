If you each owned a part of the assets, you’ll be known as ‘tenants in common’ (‘common owners’ in Scotland and ‘coparceners’ in Northern Ireland). Each part could be half or an agreed percentage of the money, shares or property.

Check with your bank if you’re not sure how the money in your accounts was divided up.

Joint tenants

You automatically inherit anything you owned as ‘joint tenants’.

You may have to pay Inheritance Tax if the whole of the deceased’s estate (all their money, property and possessions) is worth more than the Inheritance Tax threshold of £325,000 and the deceased’s estate does not pay.
