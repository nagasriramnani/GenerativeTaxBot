If you’re self-employed

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will work out how much you pay from your tax return. You pay at the same time as you pay your tax.

If you’re an employee and you do a tax return

If you earn over the minimum amount, your employer will deduct loan repayments from your salary.

Check your payslips or P60 to see how much of your loan you’ve paid off during the tax year. You’ll need to include this information when you fill in your tax return.

The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.

If you leave the UK for more than 3 months

You will need to tell the Student Loans Company (SLC). They will work out if you have to repay while you’re not in the UK and if so, how much you need to pay.
