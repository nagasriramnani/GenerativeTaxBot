Money paid in as part of a defence of tender before claim or a settlement you’ve accepted

Apply to get money you’re owed by sending the Court Funds Office both:

a request for payment (CFO 201) signed by you or your solicitor - if you sign it, your signature must be witnessed

a notice of consent (CFO 202) signed by the defendant or their solicitor - if the defendant signs it, their signature must be witnessed

Include a copy of a bank statement or letter from your bank dated within the last 3 months if you want the money paid into your bank account rather than your solicitor’s.
