How to claim

Eligibility

The application form has guidance on what building projects and materials qualify for a VAT refund. The basics are listed below.

New homes

The home must:

be separate and self-contained

be for you or your family to live or holiday in

not be for business purposes (you can use one room as a work from home office)

Builders working on new buildings should be zero-rated. You should not pay any VAT on their services.

Conversions

The building being converted must usually be a non-residential building. Residential buildings qualify if they have not been lived in for at least 10 years.
