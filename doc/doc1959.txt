Individuals (including trustees and executors, or personal representatives of a deceased person) are entitled to the Capital Gains Tax Annual Exempt Amount (AEA). You can only use the AEA once in a tax year, even if it was a split year.

Personal representatives of a deceased person who lived abroad

If you’re the personal representative of a deceased person who lived abroad, you’ll need to report the disposal to HMRC.

The AEA is available for disposals in the same tax year as the death or the following 2 tax years.

Keep records of what you report to HMRC

You need to keep records to support the gains or losses you report to HMRC.
