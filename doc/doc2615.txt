They can:

replace the property or assets - like machinery - with something of equal value if it’s for use in the business

only get relief if the donor owned the business or asset for at least 2 years before the date it was given

Any gift made more than 7 years before the donor’s death doesn’t count towards their estate for Inheritance Tax purposes.

You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax or Income Tax if you sell, give away or exchange (‘dispose of’) an asset or property if it’s gone up in value during the time you owned it.
