You’ll both need to sign a formal self-billing agreement. This is a legally binding document. The agreement must contain:

your supplier’s agreement that you, as the self-biller, can issue invoices on your supplier’s behalf

your supplier’s confirmation that they will not issue VAT invoices for goods or services covered by the agreement (because you’ll be issuing the invoices for them)

an expiry date – usually for 12 months time but it could be the date that any business contract you have with your supplier ends

your supplier’s agreement that they’ll let you know if they stop being registered for VAT, get a new VAT registration number or transfer their business as a going concern

details of any third party you intend to outsource the self-billing process to
