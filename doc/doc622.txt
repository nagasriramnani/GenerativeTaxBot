what savings or investments you have

If you have savings or assets, HMRC will expect you to use these to reduce your debt as much as possible.

If you’ve received independent debt advice, for example from Citizens Advice, you may have a ‘Standard Financial Statement’. HMRC will accept this as evidence of what you earn and spend each month.

If your company is in tax debt

HMRC will ask you to propose how you’ll pay your tax bill as quickly as you can. They will ask questions about your proposal to make sure it is realistic and affordable for you.

You must reduce your debt as much as possible before setting up a payment plan. You can do this by releasing assets like stock, vehicles and shares.

HMRC may ask company directors to:

put personal funds into the business

accept lending
