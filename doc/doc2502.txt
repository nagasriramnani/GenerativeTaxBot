If you’re unable to pay your VAT bill in full by card, you should use another payment method like a bank transfer.

Reference number

You’ll need to give your 9-digit VAT registration number. You can find your 9-digit VAT registration number:

in your VAT online account

on your VAT registration certificate

If you need to pay a VAT surcharge or penalty

You’ll need to give your 14-digit reference number beginning with ‘X’.

You can find your 14-digit reference number in the letter HMRC sent you about your surcharge or penalty.

Your payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.

Allow 3 working days for your payment to reach HM Revenue and Customs’ bank account.
