If you already paid tax on your savings income

You can reclaim tax paid on your savings interest if it was below your allowance. You must reclaim your tax within 4 years of the end of the relevant tax year.

You can claim through your Self-Assessment Tax Return if you complete one. If not, fill in form R40 and send it to HMRC.
It normally takes 6 weeks to get the tax back.
