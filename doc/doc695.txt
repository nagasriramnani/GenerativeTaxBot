Overview

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will send you a decision letter that will tell you if you can appeal against a tax decision.

You can appeal against some decisions about:

your tax bill (for example Income Tax, Corporation Tax, VAT)

a claim for tax relief

a request for information or to check your business records

a penalty (for example if you paid your tax late or filed your tax return late)

Your appeal can be made by someone who deals with your taxes, for example an accountant.
