You must calculate all other expenses by working out the actual costs.

How to use simplified expenses

Keep records of your business miles for vehicles, hours you work at home and how many people live at your business premises over the year.

At the end of the tax year use the flat rates for vehicle mileage, working from home, and living at your business premises to work out your expenses.

Include these amounts in the total for your expenses in your Self Assessment tax return.

Use the simplified expenses checker to compare what you can claim using simplified expenses with what you can claim by working out the actual costs. This will help you work out if simplified expenses suits your business.
