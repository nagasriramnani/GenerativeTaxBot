Your husband, wife or civil partner

You usually do not pay Capital Gains Tax on assets you give or sell to your spouse or civil partner. You cannot claim losses against these assets.

Other family members and ‘connected people’

You cannot deduct a loss from giving, selling or disposing of an asset to a family member unless you’re offsetting a gain from the same person.

This also applies to ‘connected people’ like business partners.

HMRC defines connected people as including:

your brothers, sisters, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren, and their husbands, wives or civil partners

the brothers, sisters, parents, grandparents, children and grandchildren of your husband, wife or civil partner - and their husbands, wives or civil partners
