the deadline for paying

who to pay

Records of judgments are kept for 6 years unless you pay the full amount within a month - this can make it hard to get credit.

What you can do if you get a judgment

If you do owe the money, you’ll need to pay it back. If you cannot afford to, you can ask to:

change the terms of (‘vary’) the judgment

pay it back in instalments

Find out what options you have for paying the judgment.

You can apply for the judgment to be cancelled (or ‘set aside’) if:

you do not owe the money

you did not receive, or did not respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money
