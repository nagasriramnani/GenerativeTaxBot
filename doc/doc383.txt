You may be able to claim tax relief if you use cars, vans, motorcycles or bicycles for work.

This does not include travelling to and from your work, unless it’s a temporary place of work.

How much you can claim depends on whether you’re using:

a vehicle that you’ve bought or leased with your own money

a vehicle owned or leased by your employer (a company vehicle)

Using your own vehicle for work
