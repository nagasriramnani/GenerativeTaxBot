‘Labour-only building or construction services’ means building services where the value of the materials supplied is less than 10% of the turnover for those services. If more than this amount, the business is classed as ‘General building or construction services’.

What you pay

You calculate the tax you pay by multiplying your VAT flat rate by your ‘VAT inclusive turnover’.

Example

You bill a customer for £1,000, adding VAT at 20% to make £1,200 in total.
