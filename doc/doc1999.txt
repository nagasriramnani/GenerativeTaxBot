their estate will be treated as having the increased Personal Allowance

your Personal Allowance will go back to the normal amount

Example

Your income is £8,000 and you transferred £1,260 of your allowance to your partner. This made your allowance £11,310 and their allowance £13,830.

After their death, their estate’s Personal Allowance stays at £13,830 and yours goes back to £12,570.

If your partner transferred some of their Personal Allowance to you before they died:

your Personal Allowance will remain at the higher level until the end of the tax year (5 April)

their estate will be treated as having the smaller amount

Example

Your partner transferred £1,260 to your Personal Allowance, making their allowance £11,310 and yours £13,830.
