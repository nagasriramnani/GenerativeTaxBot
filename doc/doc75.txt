How to respond

You’ll get a letter or email if someone claims you owe them money.  You must respond by the date on the email or letter you receive.

You can respond by:

paying the full amount

paying only what you think you owe

defending the claim (if you do not think you owe any money or you’ve already paid)

You might have to pay more or get a county court judgment (CCJ) if you do not respond in time.

If you need more time to respond

You can ask for another 14 days to respond if you’re defending the claim or paying only what you think you owe.
