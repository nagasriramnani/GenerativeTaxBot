You can pay your VAT bill online. You can also pay any surcharges or penalties you owe.

You can pay with:

a corporate credit card

a corporate debit card

a personal debit card

You cannot pay with a personal credit card.

There’s a non-refundable fee if you pay with a corporate credit card or a corporate debit card. There’s no fee if you pay with a personal debit card.

If you’re unable to pay your VAT bill in full by card, you should use another payment method like a bank transfer.
