If you want more time, Companies House will ask you to prove that you’ve made progress towards resolving your issue. For example, if the company owes you money and you have simply sent another invoice, Companies House is unlikely to extend the deadline. If you’ve started legal action to recover a debt they may do.

If you do not contact Companies House before the time limit and the company still meets all the conditions to be struck off, it will be struck off.
