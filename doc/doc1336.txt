Defined contribution - personal, stakeholder and most workplace schemes

Money in pension pots that goes towards paying you, however you decide to take the money

Defined benefit - some workplace schemes

Usually 20 times the pension you get in the first year plus your lump sum - check with your pension provider

Your pension provider may ask for information about other pension schemes you’re in so they can check if you’re above your lifetime allowance, and how much tax-free lump sum you can get when you:

decide to take money from a pension pot

turn 75

transfer your pension overseas

Pay tax if you go above your lifetime allowance
