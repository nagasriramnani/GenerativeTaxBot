Overview

Usually, VAT-registered businesses submit their VAT Returns and payments to HM Revenue and Customs 4 times a year.

With the Annual Accounting Scheme you:

make advance VAT payments towards your VAT bill - based on your last return (or estimated if you’re new to VAT)

submit 1 VAT Return a year

From 1 April 2019, most businesses will need to keep digital VAT records and use software to submit VAT Returns.

When you submit your VAT Return you either:

make a final payment - the difference between your advance payments and actual VAT bill

apply for a refund - if you’ve overpaid your VAT bill
