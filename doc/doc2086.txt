If you pay after one month

If you pay after one month, you can get the record of the judgment marked as ‘satisfied’ in the register.

It will stay on the register for 6 years but people searching the register will see that you’ve paid.

Write to the court to say you’ve paid. You’ll need to send proof of payment from the person or business you owed money to.

Getting a certificate of cancellation or satisfaction

If you want proof from the court that you’ve paid, you can apply for:

a certificate of cancellation - if you paid within one month

a certificate of satisfaction - if you paid after one month

Apply for the certificate in writing or by sending form N443 to the court that is dealing with your case.
