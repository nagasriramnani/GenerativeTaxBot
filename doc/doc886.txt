Overview

You may need to pay UK Income Tax on your foreign income, such as:

wages if you work abroad

foreign investment income, for example dividends and savings interest

rental income on overseas property

income from pensions held overseas

Foreign income is anything from outside England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are classed as foreign.

Working out if you need to pay

Whether you need to pay depends on if you’re classed as ‘resident’ in the UK for tax.
