If you travel from Northern Ireland to Great Britain through any other country you can get a refund. But any goods you buy in Northern Ireland will count towards your tax-free personal allowances when you enter Great Britain. If you go over your personal allowances, you’ll have to:

declare them along with other goods you’re carrying when you enter Great Britain

pay any import VAT due on the total goods

This may mean you have to pay VAT again on the goods you bought in Northern Ireland. But you can get a refund from the retailer if when you bought the goods you got a VAT 407(NI) form.

You may be able to get a VAT refund if you’re only traveling to Great Britain in order to change planes. You must be travelling to a non EU country and the goods must be in your hold luggage at all times.
