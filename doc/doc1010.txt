Work carried out on goods

Special rules apply for work carried out on goods.

Goods in this context means movable items, not fixed installations. Work includes any kind of physical service, including valuation, processing, manufacturing, repairs and maintenance, and alterations or finishing.

The rule for working out the place of supply of work carried out on goods is if you supply services to a:

business customer, the place of supply is the place is where the customer belongs

non-business customer, the place of supply is where you physically perform the work

Transport

For passenger transport the place of supply is where the transport takes place. If it takes place outside the UK, then it falls outside UK VAT rules.
