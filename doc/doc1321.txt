Details

Fill in form CG34 if you’ve disposed of assets and need their valuations checked and you’re:

an individual working out your Capital Gains Tax liability

a company working out your Corporation Tax liability

You must complete and send your application to the address on the form at least 3 months before your tax return filing date.

For disposals of UK property that are not regarded as your main place of residence you must report and pay Capital Gains Tax within 60 days of disposal. Therefore remember to request a valuation to allow time to report and pay any Capital Gains Tax liability.
