Your home

Your home might be sold depending on your equity - your share after any secured debts (like a mortgage) have been paid.

You might have to give up:

your equity

legal ownership of the property if your equity is Â£1,000 or more

If your trustee has not put your home up for sale within 3 years it will be transferred back to you.

Sole owners

The equity and legal ownership are transferred to your trustee. This means you cannot sell the property or claim any money from a sale.
