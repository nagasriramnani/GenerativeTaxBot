How to claim tax relief

Check HMRC’s ‘Double-taxation digest’ for countries that have an agreement with the UK, and how income like pensions and interest is taxed.

You need to look at the relevant tax treaty for the rules on other types of income like wages and rent.

Fill in a claim form

Use the correct form depending on whether you’re resident in:

Australia

Canada

France

Germany

Ireland

Japan

New Zealand

Netherlands

South Africa

Spain

Sweden

Switzerland

United States of America

If you’re resident somewhere else, use HMRC’s standard claim form.

When you’ve filled in the form, send it to the tax authority in the country where you’re resident. They’ll confirm your eligibility and either send the form to HMRC or return it to you to send on (use the address on the form).
