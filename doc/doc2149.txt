VAT is due on the selling price to your customer, even if you receive a lower amount from the finance company. The contract between your customer and the finance company for credit is a completely separate transaction.

Reclaiming VAT when you use different payment methods

If you want to reclaim VAT on payments you’ve made to your suppliers you need to have a valid VAT invoice or receipt.

If a supplier gives you an invoice that covers several payments, or an invoice showing monthly payments due in the forthcoming year, you can only reclaim the VAT on the date each payment is due or the date you send the payment, whichever happens first.
