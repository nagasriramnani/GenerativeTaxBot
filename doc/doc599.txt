If you pay back more than you owe

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will tell your employer to stop taking repayments from your salary when you have repaid your loan in full. It can take around 4 weeks for salary deductions to stop.

This means you may pay back more than you owe.

You can avoid paying more than you owe by changing your payments to direct debit in the final year of your repayments. Keep your contact details up to date so SLC can let you know how to set this up.

If you have paid too much the Student Loans Company (SLC) will try to:

contact you to tell you how to get a refund

refund you automatically (this will appear in your bank account as ‘SLC Receipts’)

You can check your loan balance in your online account.
