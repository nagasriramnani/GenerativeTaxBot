Money and shares

You do not usually have to pay Income Tax or Capital Gains Tax immediately if you inherit money or shares.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will contact you if you owe any Inheritance Tax.

Income Tax

You may have to pay Income Tax on:

interest you earn from money after you inherit it

dividends paid on shares after you inherit them

If you have an ‘R185 (estate income)’ form

The personal representative (an executor or administrator of the estate) may give you an R185 (estate income form) when you inherit.
