Written declaration

You must give your supplier an eligibility declaration or certificate when they sell you goods or services at zero rate VAT. There are examples of declarations and certificates for different goods.

If youâ€™re buying building or construction services at zero VAT, the certificate must follow a set format.

The written declaration or certificate should be separate from the order form or invoice for the goods or services your charity is buying.
