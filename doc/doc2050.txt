If your case is with the High Court you can only submit the certificate of service online. If it’s with another court you can send it there by post.

If you cannot serve the petition to the debtor in person

You can ask the court for permission to serve it in another way, for example by post.

You’ll have to provide a certificate of service confirming you’ve used a ‘substituted service’.

Court hearing

The court will tell you where and when the petition will be heard. This will be at least 14 days after you served the petition to the debtor.

The debtor can oppose the petition by giving the court a statement of truth at least 5 days before the hearing.

You must list the people that you want to appear and speak at the hearing.
