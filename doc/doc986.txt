You can ask HMRC to work out how much Inheritance Tax is due if you’re filling in the form without the help of a probate professional, such as a solicitor. You can do this when you fill in the form.

If you need help completing the form

Contact HMRC’s Inheritance Tax helpline for help with completing form IHT400.

How to amend a form after it’s been submitted

You need to fill in a corrective account form and send it to HMRC if you need to make any changes to information you’ve already submitted.

Paying Inheritance Tax

You must pay Inheritance Tax by the end of the sixth month after the person died. For example, if the person died in January, you must pay Inheritance Tax by 31 July.

You can pay in yearly instalments on certain things that may take time to sell, such as a house.
