If you move to or from Wales

Youâ€™ll only pay the Welsh rates if you live in Wales for longer than anywhere else in the UK during a tax year (6 April to 5 April the following year).

The new rates you pay will be backdated to the start of the tax year in which you moved. The tax taken from your wages or pension will be adjusted automatically so you pay the right amount across the whole tax year.

Update your address with HMRC if you move to or from Wales.

If you live in more than one home

If you have a home in Wales and one elsewhere in the UK, update your address to let HMRC know which is your main home.

Your main home is usually where you live and spend most of your time. It does not matter whether you own it, rent it or live in it for free.
