P45

You’ll get a P45 from your employer when you stop working for them.

Your P45 shows how much tax you’ve paid on your salary so far in the tax year (6 April to 5 April).

A P45 has 4 parts (Part 1, Part 1A, Part 2 and Part 3).

Your employer sends details for Part 1 to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and gives you the other parts.

You give Part 2 and 3 to your new employer (or to Jobcentre Plus if you’re not working).

Keep Part 1A for your own records.

By law your employer must give you a P45 - ask them for one.

You can check how much tax you paid last year if you think you might have paid too much.
