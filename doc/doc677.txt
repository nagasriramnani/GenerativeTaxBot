will not get an immediate repayment but should bring the credit forward to the VAT return as normal

cannot net off the credit in one month against the liability for the next month to reduce the amount of payment

should consider switching to monthly returns if you’re often in credit and you want immediate repayments of credit

If you want to use actual monthly liability contact the payments on account team.

Removing the option to pay actual monthly liabilities

You must make accurate payments of your monthly liabilities. If we’re not satisfied that you are, we’ll tell you that you can no longer pay the actual monthly liability, and we may direct you to make monthly returns or go back to the payments on account we worked out for you.
