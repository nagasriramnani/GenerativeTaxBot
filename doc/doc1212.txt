For example, if your accounting period is 9 months the limit will be 9/12 x £100,000 = £75,000.

If you’re in a partnership where one or more of the members is a limited company (not an individual), put all costs of long-life items in the special rate pool.

Single asset pools

You might need to create one or more separate pools for single assets that:

have a short life (for assets you’re not going to keep for a long time)

you use outside your business if you’re a sole trader or in a partnership

Short life assets

It’s up to you to decide whether you want to treat something as a short life asset. You cannot include:

cars

items you also use outside your business

special rate items

Large numbers of very similar items can be pooled together (for example, crockery in a restaurant).
