If your situation changes

Your status can change from one tax year to the next. Check your status if your situation changes, for example:

you spend more or less time in the UK

you buy or sell a home in the UK

you change your job

your family moves in or out of the UK, or you get married, separate or have children

Residence and capital gains

You work out your residence status for capital gains (for example, when you sell shares or a second home) the same way as you do for income.

UK residents have to pay tax on their UK and foreign gains. Non-residents have to pay tax on income, but usually only pay Capital Gains Tax either:

on UK property or land

if they return to the UK

Residence before April 2013
