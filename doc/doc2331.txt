VAT when you buy a vehicle to sell on

If you buy a vehicle to sell on, you can reclaim the VAT on your next VAT Return. You must be a VAT-registered motor dealer. When you buy a vehicle, the invoice will tell you how much VAT to pay.

Keep records when you buy a vehicle so you charge the right amount of VAT when you sell it.

If the vehicles are cars you must intend to sell them within 12 months to reclaim the VAT.

VAT on imported vehicles

You normally need to use Notification of Vehicle Arrivals (NOVA) within 14 days of importing a vehicle into the UK.

You do not need to use NOVA if any of the following apply:

the vehicles have engines below 49cc, or 7.2 kilowatts (about 9.65 horsepower) if they’re electric

you’re using a secure registration scheme
