What you'll get

Married Couple’s Allowance could reduce your tax bill each year if you’re married or in a civil partnership.

For the 2023 to 2024 tax year, it could cut your tax bill by between £401 and £1,037.50 a year.

Use the Married Couple’s Allowance calculator to work out what you could get.

If you marry or register a civil partnership, you’ll get the allowance on a pro-rata basis for the rest of that tax year.

If one of you dies or you divorce or separate, the allowance continues until the end of the tax year.

You can transfer your Married Couple’s Allowance to your spouse or civil partner.
