the years you lived in the home

the last 9 months you owned the home - even if you were not living there at the time

If you sold the property between 6 April 2014 and 6 April 2020, you get relief for the last 18 months you owned it.

If you only own one home and you’re disabled, in long-term residential care or sold the property before 6 April 2014 you get full relief for the last 36 months you owned it.

Example
You make a gain of £120,000 when you sell your home, which you owned for 15 years. You lived in the whole property for 7.5 years, then you let it out for 7.5 years.

You get Private Residence Relief for the time you lived there (7.5 years). You also get relief for the last 9 months you owned the property, even though you were not living in it.
