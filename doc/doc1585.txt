You can reclaim more if the proportion of your taxable supplies increases, but youâ€™ll have to repay some if it decreases.

If you move your own goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland

If you move your own goods from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland, you will usually be able to recover the full amount of VAT as if it had been a taxable supply.

However, if you make supplies that are exempt from VAT you may not be able to recover some or all of the VAT on goods when they are first purchased. If you then move the goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland you will incur a VAT charge.
