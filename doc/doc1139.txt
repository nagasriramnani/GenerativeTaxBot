Search for people with Bankruptcy or Debt Relief Restrictions

Search the list of people with additional insolvency restrictions for the last 3 months.

The list contains details of people who have broken the terms of their bankruptcy or Debt Relief Order. They will have been given a penalty, called a Bankruptcy Restrictions Order (BRO) or Undertaking (BRU) or a Debt Relief Restrictions Order (DRRO) or Undertaking (DRRU).
