How to start

You can start using a margin scheme at any time by keeping the correct records, and then reporting it on your VAT return. You do not have to register.

You’ll have to pay VAT on the full selling price of each item if you do not meet all the scheme’s requirements.

Exceptions

There are different rules if you’re selling:

second-hand vehicles

horses and ponies

houseboats and caravans

items that have been pawned

high volume, low price items - you can use the Global Accounting Scheme, a simplified version of the VAT margin scheme

There are also different rules:

for auctioneers

for agents

if you buy and sell goods in Northern Ireland and the EU

Check if you can use a VAT margin scheme if you import from, or export to, countries outside the UK.
