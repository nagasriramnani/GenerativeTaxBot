The original and the replacement property combined must satisfy the conditions shown under ‘Gifts of agricultural property’.

If the agricultural property was in a person’s estate when they died and it had replaced other agricultural property it can still qualify for Agricultural Relief if the original and replacement property:

has been occupied by the owner, for the purposes of agriculture, for a total period of at least 2 years during the 5 years immediately before the death

was owned and occupied (either by the owner or by someone else) for the purposes of agriculture for at least 7 years during the 10 years immediately before the death

Relief is limited to what would have been available before the replacement.
