Deadlines

The deadline for submitting your return online is usually one calendar month and 7 days after the end of an accounting period. This is also the deadline for paying HMRC. You need to allow time for the payment to reach HMRC’s account.

Use your online account to:

find out when your VAT Returns are due

find out when the payment must clear HMRC’s account

check and appeal penalties

If you use the VAT annual accounting scheme, you can set up an email reminder each time your VAT Return is due through your online account.
