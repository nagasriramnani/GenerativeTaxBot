If you do not have a P45

Your new employer will need to work out how much tax you should be paying on your salary if you do not have a P45. For example, if:

you’re starting your first job

you’re taking on a second job

you cannot get your P45 from your previous employer

You’ll need to tell your new employer about things like other jobs you have, any benefits you get and if you have a student loan. They’ll ask you to either fill in a ‘starter checklist’ or give the information in another way.

Your employer will use this information to work out your correct tax code before your first payday if you do not have a P45.
