Reclaim VAT on business expenses

You can reclaim VAT on items you buy for use in your business. Do this in your VAT return.

If those items are also for personal use, you can only claim the business proportion of the VAT.

Examples

Half of your mobile phone calls are personal. You can reclaim 50% of the VAT on the purchase price and the service plan.

You work from home and your office takes up 20% of the floor space in your house. You can reclaim 20% of the VAT on your utility bills.
