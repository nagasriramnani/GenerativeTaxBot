Hire purchase agreements

If the finance company becomes the owner of goods, you’re supplying the goods to the finance company and not your customer. You do not make a charge for providing the credit. So you account for VAT on the value of the goods at the time you supply them to the finance company.

Any commission that you receive from the finance company for introducing them to your customer may be subject to VAT.

Loan agreements

If the finance company does not become the owner of the goods, you’re supplying goods directly to your customer. You’re not supplying them to the finance company, even though the finance company may pay you direct.
