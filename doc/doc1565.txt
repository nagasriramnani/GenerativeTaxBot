Sending tax returns

You must report the trust’s income and gains in a trust and estate Self Assessment tax return after the end of each tax year. You can either:

buy software to send it electronically by 31 January

fill in paper form SA900 and post it to HMRC by 31 October (3 months earlier)

You can also get help, for example from HMRC or by getting an accountant to do your return for you.

After you’ve sent your return, HMRC will tell you how much you owe. You’ll need to pay your Self Assessment bill by the deadline.

You’ll need to collect and keep records (for example bank statements) to complete your tax return.
