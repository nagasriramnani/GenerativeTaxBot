HMRC can charge you a penalty if your records are not accurate, complete and readable.

Lost or destroyed records

Try to get copies of as much as you can, for example ask banks for copies of statements or suppliers for duplicate invoices.

You can use ‘provisional’ or ‘estimated’ figures if you cannot recreate all your records. You must use the ‘Any other information’ box on the tax return to say that this is what you’re doing.

‘Provisional’ means you’ll be able to get paperwork to confirm your figures later. ‘Estimated’ means you will not be able to confirm the figures.

You may have to pay interest and penalties if your figures turn out to be wrong and you have not paid enough tax.
