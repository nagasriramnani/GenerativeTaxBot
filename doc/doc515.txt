VAT rates

There are 3 rates of VAT.

Standard rate

Most goods and services are standard rate. Charge this rate unless the goods or services are classed as reduced or zero-rated.

This includes any goods below the distance selling threshold you supply from Northern Ireland to non VAT-registered EU customers. If you go over the threshold, youâ€™ll have to register for VAT in that country.

Reduced rate

When you can charge this rate depends on the item and the circumstances of the sale, for example:

child car seats and domestic fuel or power are charged at 5%
