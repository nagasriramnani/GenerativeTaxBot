Calculation of Double Taxation Relief

Work out the Inheritance Tax due on Brian’s estate.

Estate = £500,000 
Less threshold = £325,000 
Total = £175,000 
Inheritance Tax due @ 40% = £70,000

Calculate the proportion of the Inheritance Tax that is attributable to the American apartment using the formula.

Value of asset ÷ total value of the estate x IHT = 35,000 ÷ 500,000 x 70,000 = £4,900 Inheritance Tax on the American apartment.

The American tax actually paid was £1,500, so the relief is limited to the £1,500 actually paid.
