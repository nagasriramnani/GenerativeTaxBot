If you transfer an asset after you’ve divorced or ended your civil partnership

You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax on assets you transfer after your relationship has legally ended.

the final order or decree absolute if you’re divorced

the final order if you have ended a civil partnership

any court order, if assets were transferred this way
