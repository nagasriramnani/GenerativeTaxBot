When you must register a trust

Trustees - tax responsibilities

As the trustee, you’re responsible for reporting and paying tax on behalf of the trust.

If there are 2 or more trustees, nominate one as the ‘principal acting trustee’ to manage its tax. The other trustees are still accountable, and can be charged tax and interest if the trust does not pay.

Registering a trust

Once a trust becomes liable for tax, you must register the trust with HM Revenue and Customs.
