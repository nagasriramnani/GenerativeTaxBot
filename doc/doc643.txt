it has proper planning permission

any existing buildings on the site have been demolished completely to ground level (unless you’re extending an existing building to create a new house or flat)

Example

A ‘granny flat’ or annexe you’re building as an addition to an existing house cannot be used or sold separately to the main house. This means you must charge VAT at the standard rate of 20%.

For mixed-use buildings, like a shop with a flat above it, only the work on the residential part can be zero-rated for VAT.
