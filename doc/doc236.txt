Goods and services that are ‘out of scope’

Some goods and services are outside the VAT tax system (‘out of scope’) so you cannot charge or reclaim the VAT on them. For example:

goods or services you buy and use outside of the UK

statutory fees, like the London congestion charge

goods you sell as part of a hobby, like stamps from a collection

donations to a charity, if given without getting anything in return

Charging VAT to charities

VAT-registered businesses can sell certain goods and services to charities at the zero or reduced rate of VAT.

Find out what qualifies for the reduced rate.

If you’re a VAT-registered business, it’s your responsibility to check the charity is eligible, and to apply the correct rate.
