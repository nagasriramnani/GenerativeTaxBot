Payroll for female employees who pay less National Insurance

If a female employee gives you a ‘certificate of election’ form, she may be able to pay less National Insurance.

Until 1977, married women could choose to pay less National Insurance. If your employee opted in before the scheme ended, she can keep paying a reduced rate.

Checking your employee’s entitlement

You can accept one of the following forms:

CA4139

CF383

CF380A - if your employee has worked for you continuously since 5 April 1980

If your employee doesn’t have her certificate, she should apply for one by sending HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) a completed CF9 form (if she’s married) or CF9A form (for widows).
