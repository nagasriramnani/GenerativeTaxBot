You’ll be paid a ‘repayment supplement’. The repayment supplement is £50 or 5% of your repayment  - whichever is the higher amount.

If your return is received before the end of the accounting period it’s for, the 30 days will start at the end of the period.

You will not get a repayment supplement if, for example:

HMRC receives your VAT Return after your payment deadline

you made errors on your return that reduce your claim by more than 5% or £250 (whichever is higher)

you have earlier returns missing at the time your current return is received by HMRC

If your accounting period started on or after 1 January 2023

If HMRC is late in paying you, you may be entitled to repayment interest on any VAT that you are owed.
