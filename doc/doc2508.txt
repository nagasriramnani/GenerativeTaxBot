businesses and business assets

These reliefs reduce the value of these assets, often by 100%. Include the reduced value of the assets after you’ve taken off any relief when you calculate the value of the estate in your report to HMRC.

any unused basic threshold from a late spouse or civil partner’s estate

the residence nil rate band of £175,000
