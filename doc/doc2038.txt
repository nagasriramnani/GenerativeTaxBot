In her will she leaves half of the property to her step-son and half to her nephew.

You work out the available residence nil rate band based on how much the property left to the step-son was worth (£250,000). But, the actual residence allowance for the estate is restricted to £175,000. This is the lower of the maximum available allowance for tax year 2020 to 2021 (£175,000) and value of the half share of the home (£250,000).

It does not matter how the step-son inherits the home. The home could be left to the step-son as a specific legacy in the will, or it could be included in what’s left of the estate (the residue) after specific legacies have been taken into account.
