Your taxable income (your income minus your Personal Allowance and any Income Tax reliefs) is £20,000 and your taxable gains are £12,600. Your gains are not from residential property.

First, deduct the Capital Gains tax-free allowance from your taxable gain. For the 2023 to 2024 tax year the allowance is £6,000, which leaves £6,600 to pay tax on.

Add this to your taxable income. Because the combined amount of £26,600 is less than £37,700 (the basic rate band for the 2023 to 2024 tax year), you pay Capital Gains Tax at 10%.
