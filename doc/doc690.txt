If you use HMRC’s online services

Log in to your HMRC online account.

Go to ‘Self Assessment’, then ‘More Self Assessment details’.

If you use commercial software

If you or your accountant use commercial software to do your return, you’ll need to use that software to print your tax calculation. It might be called something different in the software - for example ‘tax computation’.

Contact the company that makes the software if you have trouble printing.

You can still print a tax year overview from your HMRC online account.

Contact HMRC

You can contact HMRC if you have any problems getting the documents.
