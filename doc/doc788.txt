You’ll be:

repaid if you’ve paid too much tax - you may also get interest on the amount you’re owed

asked to pay additional tax within 30 days if you owe more - you’ll normally have to pay interest from the date the tax was due

You may also have to pay a penalty. HMRC will look at:

the reasons why you underpaid or overclaimed the tax

whether you told HMRC as soon as you could

how helpful you’ve been during the check

If you have problems paying, tell the officer dealing with the check.

You can appeal a tax decision if you disagree with it.
