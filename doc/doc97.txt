If you do not, the form you fill in to claim your refund depends on whether the payment:

used up the pension pot and you have no other income in the tax year

used up the pension pot and you have other taxable income

did not use up the pension pot and you’re not taking regular payments

There’s a different way to claim if your payment came from a trust.
