Inheritance Tax reduced rate calculator

You may qualify to pay Inheritance Tax at a reduced rate of 36% if you leave at least 10% of your net estate to charity.

Use this calculator to work out the amount needed to qualify if you’re:

preparing your own will

the executor of the deceased’s will or administrator of their estate - if the death was after 6 April 2012

You can’t use this calculator if:

the death was before 6 April 2012

there are charges from the deferral of tax for woodlands or heritage assets - tax on these is always 40%

Inheritance Tax is due on a trust and there has been no death
