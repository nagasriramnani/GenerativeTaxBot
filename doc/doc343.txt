Gift Hold-Over Relief

You may be able to claim Gift Hold-Over Relief if you give away business assets (including certain shares) or sell them for less than they’re worth to help the buyer.

Gift Hold-Over Relief means:

you do not pay Capital Gains Tax when you give away the assets

the person you give them to pays Capital Gains tax (if any is due) when they sell (or ‘dispose of’) them

Tax is not usually payable on gifts to your husband, wife, civil partner or a charity.

Eligibility

The conditions for claiming relief depend on whether you’re giving away business assets or shares.

If you’re giving away business assets

You must:

be a sole trader or business partner, or have at least 5% of voting rights in a company (known as your ‘personal company’)
