What you pay it on

You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you make a profit (‘gain’) when you sell (or ‘dispose of’) a personal possession for £6,000 or more.

Possessions you may need to pay tax on include:

jewellery

paintings

antiques

coins and stamps

sets of things, eg matching vases or chessmen

You’ll need to work out your gain to find out whether you need to pay tax.

When you don’t pay it

You don’t usually need to pay tax on gifts to your husband, wife, civil partner or a charity.

You don’t pay Capital Gains Tax on:
