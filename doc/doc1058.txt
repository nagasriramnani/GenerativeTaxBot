Additional vehicle costs

You can usually reclaim the VAT for:

all business-related running and maintenance costs, like repairs or off-street parking

any accessories you’ve fitted for business use

You can do this even if you cannot reclaim VAT on the vehicle itself.

Travel expenses

You can reclaim VAT on employee travel expenses for business trips. Travel expenses can include transport, meals and accommodation that you pay for. Find out who counts as an employee.

You can reclaim VAT on other kinds of expenses (not just those related to travel) for self-employed people who are treated as employees.

You cannot reclaim VAT if you pay your employees a flat rate for expenses.
