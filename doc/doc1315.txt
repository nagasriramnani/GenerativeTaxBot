Contracting out

You could only contract out of the Additional State Pension if your employer ran a contracted-out pension scheme. Check with them.

While you were a member of a contracted-out workplace pension you did not contribute to the Additional State Pension. In some cases, you could get the Second State Pension even if you did not contribute, for example if your earnings were low.

You cannot contract out after 6 April 2016. If you were contracted out, your National Insurance contributions increased to your standard rate after this date.
