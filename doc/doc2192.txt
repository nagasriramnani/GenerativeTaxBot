Deduct any reliefs that apply to agricultural assets,  businesses and business assets.

Take off the value of any assets left to spouses, civil partners, charities or assets that are exempt for other reasons. This gives you the value of the estate that’s taxable.

Work out the available Inheritance Tax threshold. Take the basic threshold of £325,000, including any unused basic threshold from a late spouse or civil partner’s estate, and deduct the value of any gifts made within 7 years of the death from it. If the value of the gifts is more than the basic threshold, there’ll be Inheritance Tax to pay on those gifts. Add any residence nil rate band (RNRB), including anything transferred from a late spouse or civil partner, to get to the available threshold.
