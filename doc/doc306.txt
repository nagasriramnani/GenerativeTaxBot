Penalties

You’ll get a penalty if you need to send a tax return and you miss the deadline for submitting it or paying your bill.

You’ll pay a late filing penalty of £100 if your tax return is up to 3 months late. You’ll have to pay more if it’s later, or if you pay your tax bill late.

You’ll be charged interest on late payments.

Estimate your penalty for Self Assessment tax returns more than 3 months late, and late payments.

You can appeal against a penalty if you have a reasonable excuse.
