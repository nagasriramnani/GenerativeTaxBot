If you accept a review by HMRC

You will have your tax decision reviewed by someone at HMRC who was not involved in the original decision. This is known as a ‘statutory review’.

HMRC will tell you when you can have a review.

Reviews usually take 45 days, but HMRC will contact you if it will take longer.

HMRC will write to tell you the result of its review.

Appealing to the tax tribunal

You can appeal to the tax tribunal:

if you disagree with HMRC’s review decision - you must usually do this within 30 days of the review decision

instead of accepting a review by HMRC

You can also consider alternative dispute resolution (ADR), but you need to appeal to the tax tribunal first.
