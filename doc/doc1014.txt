Get your rent in full

If you want to pay tax on your rental income through Self Assessment, fill in form NRL1i and send it back to HMRC.

If your application is approved, HMRC will tell your letting agent or tenant not to deduct tax from your rent and you’ll need to declare your income in your Self Assessment tax return.

HMRC will not approve your application if your taxes are not up to date, for example you’re late with your tax returns or payments.

Get your rent with tax deducted

Your letting agent or tenant will:

deduct basic rate tax from your rent (after allowing for any expenses they’ve paid)

give you a certificate at the end of the tax year saying how much tax they’ve deducted
