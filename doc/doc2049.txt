It’ll go to the High Court.

Otherwise, give the petition in person to the county court nearest to where the debtor lives or works.

Choose the court nearest to the debtor’s business address unless this changed in the last 6 months and they’ve been at their home address longer.

After you apply

You’ll need to give (‘serve’) a copy of the petition to the debtor in person.

If the debtor has an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) you’ll also need to give a copy to the supervisor.

Send the court a certificate of service (form N215) to confirm you’ve done this.
