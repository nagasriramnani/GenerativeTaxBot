Pensions

You have to pay tax on pensions if you’re resident, or were resident in any of the 5 previous tax years.

You also pay tax on any foreign pension payments, including unauthorised payments like early payments and some lump sums.

Check with your pension provider to find out how you’ll be taxed.
