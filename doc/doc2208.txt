Challenge a statutory demand

If you do not agree with a statutory demand you’ve been given, you can apply to challenge it and get it ‘set aside’.

You can be made bankrupt or your company wound up if you ignore a statutory demand.

You must apply to the court named on your statutory demand. Contact a solicitor or your nearest county court if you’re not sure where to send your application.

You cannot challenge a statutory demand if it was served on a company. You can apply to stop your creditors from winding up your company instead.
