For the tax years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 - or if you cannot access the internet - you’ll need to ask HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for a paper form.

HMRC will send you a 14-digit reference number starting with ‘x’ after you’ve reported your capital gains. You’ll need your reference number to pay what you owe within the deadline.

If you’re not a UK resident

You must report all sales and disposals of UK property or land by the deadline, even if you have no tax to pay.

If you sold UK property or land before 6 April 2020, you’ll need to report your gains using a non-resident Capital Gains Tax return.

If you’re reporting on behalf of someone else or an estate

Use your own Capital Gains Tax on UK property account to report for someone else.
