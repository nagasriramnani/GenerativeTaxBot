You might have to pay Capital Gains Tax if you sell the shares.

Youâ€™ll not pay Capital Gains Tax if you transfer the shares:

to an Individual Savings Account (ISA) within 90 days of the scheme ending

to a pension, directly from the scheme when it ends

If you do not transfer your shares to a pension immediately when the scheme ends, you can still transfer them up to 90 days later. You may have to pay Capital Gains Tax if they go up in value between when you buy them and when you transfer them.
