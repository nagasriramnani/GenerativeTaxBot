Apply to get money you’re owed by sending the Court Funds Office a request for payment (CFO 201) signed by you or your solicitor - if you sign it, your signature must be witnessed.

Include a copy of a bank statement or letter from your bank dated within the last 3 months if you want the money paid into your bank account rather than your solicitor’s.
