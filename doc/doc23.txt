How your tax is paid

Your pension provider will take off any tax you owe before they pay you. They’ll also take off any tax you owe on your State Pension.

If you get payments from more than one provider (for example, from a workplace pension and a personal pension), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will ask one of your providers to take the tax off your State Pension.
