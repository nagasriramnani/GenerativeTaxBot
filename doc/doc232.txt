Who can use cash basis

You can use cash basis if you:

run a small self-employed business, for example sole trader or partnership

have a turnover of £150,000 or less a year

If you have more than one business, you must use cash basis for all your businesses. The combined turnover from your businesses must be less than £150,000.

If you use cash basis and your business grows during the tax year

You can stay in the scheme up to a total business turnover of £300,000 per year. Above that, you’ll need to use traditional accounting for your next tax return.
