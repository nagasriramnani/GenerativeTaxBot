It’s up to you to make sure you’re not getting tax relief on pension contributions worth more than 100% of your annual earnings. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) can ask you to pay back anything over this limit.

Relief at source

You get relief at source in all personal and stakeholder pensions, and some workplace pensions.

To get relief at source

Before paying into a scheme, you need to agree to certain conditions about your contributions (‘make declarations’). Your pension provider will tell you what these are.

You also need to give your pension provider your:

full name and address

date of birth

National Insurance number

employment status - or tell them if you’re retired, a full time student, a carer or aged under 16
