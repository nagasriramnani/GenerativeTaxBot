Reference number

Use your National Insurance number followed by ‘IC’, your surname then your initial. If your bank limits you to a certain amount of characters, you should use your National Insurance number followed by ‘IC’ and as much of your surname as possible.

Example

If your name is Anne Jones, you’d write the reference as QQ123456AICJONESA

If you’re an employer paying for an employee living abroad, you should use your 13-character employer number.
