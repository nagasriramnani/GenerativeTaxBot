Complain about an insolvency practitioner

If you’re not happy with your insolvency practitioner’s service, you must first complain to them directly.

An insolvency practitioner can also be called a:

trustee in personal bankruptcy cases

supervisor in a Company Voluntary Arrangement or Individual Voluntary Arrangement

liquidator if a company is being wound up and its assets sold off

receiver, administrator or administrative receiver

If you’re not satisfied with their response, you can use this online form to complain to their professional (authorising) body.

You can only complain about something that happened:

in the past 3 years

more than 3 years ago if you first found evidence of the issue in the past 3 years
