            What to do when someone dies: step by step

Step 1:
                  
                
              

              
                Register the death
              
          


          
              Register the death within 5 days 

              Check what to do if: 

              
the death has been reported to a coroner 
the death happened outside the UK 
you're registering a stillbirth 
someone is missing and you think they're dead 


              To stop or change benefits payments you can tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about the death straight away.
