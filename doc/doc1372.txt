Savings in tax-free accounts like Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) and some National Savings and Investments accounts do not count towards your allowance.

There are different rules for tax on foreign savings and childrenâ€™s accounts.

Interest on joint accounts

If you have a joint account, interest will be split equally between the account holders. Contact the savings helpline if you think it should be split differently.

If you go over your allowance

You pay tax on any interest over your allowance at your usual rate of Income Tax.
