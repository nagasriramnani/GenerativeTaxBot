Overview

When you buy shares, you usually pay a tax or duty of 0.5% on the transaction.

If you buy:

shares electronically, you’ll pay Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT)

shares using a stock transfer form, you’ll pay Stamp Duty if the transaction is over £1,000

You’ll have to pay tax at 1.5% if you transfer shares into some ‘depositary receipt schemes’ or ‘clearance services’.

You pay tax on the price you pay for the shares, even if their actual market value is much higher.
