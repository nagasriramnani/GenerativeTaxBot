If theyâ€™re outside of the UK and you want them to manage any tax affairs, they can send the original or certified copy to:

HM Revenue and Customs
Benton Park View
Newcastle Upon Tyne
NE98 1ZZ

The copy will be returned to them. After that, if they sent in a letter with the copy, they should get a reply letter from HMRC. They should not need to send in a copy again, unless the details of the power of attorney change.
