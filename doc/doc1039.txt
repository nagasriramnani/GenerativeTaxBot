Check if probate is needed

Contact the financial organisations the person who died used (for example, their bank and mortgage company) to find out if you’ll need probate to get access to their assets. Every organisation has its own rules.

You may not need probate if the person who died:

only had savings

owned shares or money with others - this automatically passes to the surviving owners unless they’ve agreed otherwise

owned land or property as ‘joint tenants’ with others - this automatically passes to the surviving owners

Check if you can apply for probate

Only certain people can apply for probate. Who can apply depends on whether or not there’s a will.

If there’s a will, executors named in it can apply.

If there’s not a will, the closest living relative can apply.
