You can choose how you record when money is received or paid (for example the date the money enters your account or the date a cheque is written) but you must use the same method each tax year.

All payments count - cash, card, cheque, payment in kind or any other method.

Expenses

Expenses are business costs you can deduct from your income to calculate your taxable profit.  In practice, this means your allowable expenses reduce your Income Tax.

Only count the expenses you’ve actually paid. Money you owe isn’t counted until you pay it.

Examples of allowable business expenses if you’re using cash basis are:

day to day running costs, such as electricity, fuel

admin costs, for example stationery

things you use in your business, such as machinery, computers, vans
