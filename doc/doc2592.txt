Overview

The amount of VAT a business pays or claims back from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is usually the difference between the VAT charged by the business to customers and the VAT the business pays on their own purchases.

With the Flat Rate Scheme:

you pay a fixed rate of VAT to HMRC

you keep the difference between what you charge your customers and pay to HMRC

you cannot reclaim the VAT on your purchases - except for certain capital assets over Â£2,000
