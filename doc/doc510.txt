Who can apply for a National Insurance number

You can apply for a National Insurance number if you:

live in the UK

have the right to work in the UK

are working, looking for work or have an offer to start work

You can start work before you receive your National Insurance number if you can prove you have the right to work in the UK.

If you already have a National Insurance number, you do not need to apply for a new one, even if your personal details change. Your National Insurance number remains the same for life.
