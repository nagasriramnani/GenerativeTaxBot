Paying deferred National Insurance

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will check if you’ve paid enough National Insurance at the end of the tax year, and they’ll write to you if you owe anything.

To pay, send your payslip and a cheque to HMRC. If you do not have a payslip, include a letter with the following information:

name, address, telephone number

your National Insurance number

the amount you’re paying
