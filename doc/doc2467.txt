You might be able to claim UK benefits like Jobseeker’s Allowance while you’re living in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland. Whether you can depends on the agreement between the UK and the country you’re moving to.

If your circumstances change

Contact HMRC if your circumstances change when you’re abroad - you move house or your marital status changes, for example. You’ll need your National Insurance number.

You also need to tell HMRC if you come back to live in the UK.

Visiting the UK

You can visit the UK without becoming resident again - depending on why you visit and how long you visit for.
