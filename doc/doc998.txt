You do not have to order and pay for the product yourself - a friend, local council, charity or housing association can do it for you.

How to get the reduced rate

Your supplier should know about the reduced rate and apply it. You qualify if:

you’re over 60 when the product is supplied or installed

the product is installed - you do not get the reduced rate if you just buy it

the product is for a private home, for example your own home or one shared with friends or relatives (a residential care home does not qualify)

You’ll need to confirm to your supplier in writing that you meet these conditions. They may give you a form, or you can sign your own declaration. Ask a relative, partner or other responsible person if you’re not able to fill it in yourself.
