You work out the residence nil rate band based on the value of the property left to the step-son (£250,000). But the actual residence nil rate band for the estate is restricted to £175,000. This is the lower of the maximum residence nil rate band for tax year 2020 to 2021 (£175,000) and value of the half share of the home (£250,000).

How the direct descendants inherit the home

For homes that qualify for the residence nil rate band, there are rules about how the direct descendants inherit a home.

The home must be left to them:

in the will of the person that’s died

under the rules of intestacy

by some other legal means
