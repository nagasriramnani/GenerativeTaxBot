Private Residence Relief

Trustees pay no Capital Gains Tax when they sell a property the trust owns. It must be the main residence for someone allowed to live there under the rules of the trust.

Business Asset Disposal Relief

Trustees pay 10% Capital Gains Tax on qualifying gains if they sell assets used in a beneficiaryâ€™s business, which has now ended. They may also get relief when they sell shares in a company where the beneficiary had at least 5% of shares and voting rights.

Hold-Over Relief

Trustees pay no tax if they transfer assets to beneficiaries (or other trustees in some cases). The recipient pays tax when they sell or dispose of the assets, unless they also claim relief.
