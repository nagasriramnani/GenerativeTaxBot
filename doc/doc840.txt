if you need to pay tax when you sell (or ‘dispose of’) your home

how to work out how much Private Residence Relief you get

What counts as your home

You must have lived in your home as your only or main residence at some point while you owned it.

If you’re married or in a civil partnership only one home per couple counts as your main residence at any one time.

When you don’t get relief

You don’t get tax relief if you bought it just to make a gain.

If you or your home are overseas

You may get relief if the property is in the UK, but you’re not a UK resident.

From 6 April 2015, you must spend at least 90 days in an overseas property to qualify for relief for that tax year.
