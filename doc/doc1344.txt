Calculate tax on employees' company cars

As an employer, if you provide company cars or fuel for your employees’ private use, you’ll need to work out the taxable value so you can report this to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

‘Private use’ includes employees’ journeys between home and work, unless they’re travelling to a temporary place of work.

Work out taxable value

You can calculate taxable value using commercial payroll software.

Or you can use HMRC’s company car and car fuel benefit calculator if it works in your browser.

Using the HMRC calculator

Choose fuel type ‘F’ for diesel cars that meet the Euro 6d standard (also known as Real Driving Emissions 2). Choose type ‘D’ for other diesel cars.
