When you call

These helplines use speech recognition software, so you’ll be asked why you are calling HMRC. Try to answer with short phrases and words, for example:

‘change my address’

‘question about my tax code’

‘question about taxable expenses’

If you cannot use speech recognition software, find out how to get help from HMRC if you need extra support.
