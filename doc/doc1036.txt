what you disagree with and why

You can also include what you think the correct figures are and how you’ve calculated them if you like.

You should also tell HMRC if you have any extra information or if you think they’ve missed something.

After you send your appeal

The case worker who made the decision will look at your case again and consider your appeal.

If they do not change their decision after this, you’ll be offered a review. This is where the decision is looked at by someone at HMRC who was not involved in the original decision.

You can accept the offer of a review or appeal to the tax tribunal.

Reviews are usually quicker than appeals to the tax tribunal.

You’ll have 30 days from the date of the review offer to accept the offer of a review.
