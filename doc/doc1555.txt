Overview

Your tax code is used by your employer or pension provider to work out how much Income Tax to take from your pay or pension. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will tell them which code to use.

This guide is also available in Welsh (Cymraeg).

Find your tax code

You can find your tax code:

by checking your tax code for the current year online - you’ll need to sign in to or create a personal tax account

on the HMRC app

on your payslip

on a ‘Tax Code Notice’ letter from HMRC if you get one

If you sign in to check your tax code online, you can also find your tax code for a previous tax year.
