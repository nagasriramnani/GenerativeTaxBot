Tax-free allowance

Trustees only have to pay Capital Gains Tax if the total taxable gain is above the trust’s tax-free allowance (called the ‘annual exempt amount’).

For the 2023 to 2024 tax year, the tax-free allowance for trusts is:

£3,000

£6,000 if the beneficiary is vulnerable - a disabled person or a child whose parent has died

If there’s more than one beneficiary, the higher allowance may apply even if only one of them is vulnerable.

See tax-free allowances for previous tax years.

The tax-free allowance may be reduced if the trust’s settlor has set up more than one trust (‘settlement’) since 6 June 1978.
