What to report to HMRC

Report directors’ pay and deductions in your Full Payment Submission (FPS).

Put one of the following into the ‘Director’s NIC calculation method’ field on your FPS:

‘AN’ if you’re using the ‘standard annual earnings period method’

‘AL’ for the ‘alternative method’

Fill in the ‘Week of director’s appointment’ field.

When to pay

Contributions are calculated on annual earnings but they’re still paid to HMRC after you run your usual payroll (for example, weekly, monthly or quarterly).

Category letter changes

The director might be due a National Insurance refund if their category letter changes (for example, because they reach State Pension age).
