Administration orders

An administration order is a way to deal with debt if you have a county court or High Court judgment against you and you cannot pay in full.

The debt must be less than £5,000.

You make one payment a month to your local court. The court will divide this money between your creditors.

Creditors listed on the administration order cannot take any further action against you without the court’s permission.
