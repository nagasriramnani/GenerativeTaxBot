You can also pay by postal order or cheque (payable to ‘HM Courts and Tribunals Service’) if you use the paper claim form.

You may have to pay more fees later on - for example, if there’s a court hearing or you need to get a judgment enforced.

You may be able to claim the fees back if you win the case.
