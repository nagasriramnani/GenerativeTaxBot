Delay payment while appealing

You may be able to delay paying a tax bill or penalty if you disagree with the amount.

Direct tax

If you’ve appealed to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) against a direct tax decision (such as Income Tax, Corporation Tax or Capital Gains Tax) write to the HMRC office that sent you the decision, telling them:

why you think the amount you’ve been asked to pay is too much

what you think the correct amount is and when you’ll pay it

HMRC will tell you in writing if they agree.
