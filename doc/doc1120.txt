This gives you a total income of £32,570.

You have a Personal Allowance of £12,570. Take this off your total income to leave a taxable income of £20,000.

This is in the basic rate tax band, so you would pay:

20% tax on £17,000 of wages

no tax on £2,000 of dividends, because of the dividend allowance

8.75% tax on £1,000 of dividends

Pay tax on up to £10,000 in dividends

Tell HMRC by:

contacting the helpline

asking HMRC to change your tax code - the tax will be taken from your wages or pension

putting it in your Self Assessment tax return, if you already fill one in

You do not need to tell HMRC if your dividends are within the dividend allowance for the tax year.

Pay tax on over £10,000 in dividends

You’ll need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return.
