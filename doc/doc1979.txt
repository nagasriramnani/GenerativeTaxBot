There’s a different process for applying for probate in Northern Ireland.

If you apply for probate online, you need to complete the probate form before you submit the IHT205 form. Once you’ve completed the probate form, you’ll be given a 16-digit reference number which you need to include when you send the IHT205 paper form.

If you apply for probate by post, you need to send the completed probate form together with the IHT205 form.

If you have an Inheritance Tax identifier number

You’ll have an Inheritance Tax identifier number if you reported the value of the estate online before 31 December 2022.

You can only use your identifier number in your probate application up to 31 March 2023.
