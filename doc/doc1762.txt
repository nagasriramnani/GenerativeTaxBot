There are special rules for works of art, antiques or collectors’ items imported from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and works of art bought directly from the creator or their heirs.

Margin schemes and standard VAT

If some of the items you buy and sell are not eligible for a margin scheme, you pay and charge VAT for those items in the normal way.

You cannot include any of the following in your calculations when using a margin scheme:

business overheads

repairs

parts or accessories

Instead, reclaim these on your VAT return in the normal way.

Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you’re not sure about a particular item.
