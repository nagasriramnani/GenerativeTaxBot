If your tax bill for the 2022 to 2023 tax year is more than £3,000 (the total of your 2 payments on account), you’ll need to make a ‘balancing payment’ by 31 January 2024.

Payments on account do not include anything you owe for capital gains or student loans (if you’re self-employed) - you’ll pay those in your ‘balancing payment’.

Check your payments on account

Sign in to your online account.

Select the option to view your latest Self Assessment return.

Select ‘View statements’.

You’ll then be able to see:
