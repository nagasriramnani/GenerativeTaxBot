Reporting and paying Capital Gains Tax

You do not get a bill for Capital Gains Tax. You must work out if your total gains are above your tax-free allowance.

If your total taxable gains are above your allowance, youâ€™ll need to report and pay Capital Gains Tax.

You may get tax relief if you sold a property that was your main home.

When to report and pay

You must report any capital gains and pay any money you owe by the deadline.
