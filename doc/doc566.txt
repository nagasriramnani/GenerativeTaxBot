looking through financial documents

Record the value of any gift and the date it was made.

Estimate the gift’s value

To estimate the value of each gift, use either:

the approximate value of the gift at the time it was made (realistic selling price)

the realistic selling price of the gift if the deceased continued to benefit from the gift after giving it away (a ‘gift with reservation’)

Debts

Do not include the estate’s debts when you estimate the gross value. You will however need to tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) about any debts when you report the value of the estate.

Check for records of debts when the person died, for example:

their mortgage, loans, credit cards or overdrafts
