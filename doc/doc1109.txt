If you’re seconded to the UK

You may be able to claim Overseas Workday Relief if your employer sends you to work in the UK on secondment.

If you qualify you:

pay UK tax on UK employment income based on the number of days you’ve worked here

do not pay tax on income from days you work abroad (as long as you do not bring it into the UK)

Ask your employer to find out if you can claim.
