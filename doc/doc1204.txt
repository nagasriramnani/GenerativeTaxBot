terminal illness

Someone who’s temporarily disabled or incapacitated, or elderly and frail but not disabled, does not qualify. However, you may be able to charge reduced-rate VAT at 5% on mobility aids, heating and security work for people over 60.

Alterations

Work on a disabled person’s home that can be zero-rated includes:

building a ramp

widening (but not building) a doorway or passage

installing, extending or adapting a bathroom, washroom or lavatory to suit their condition

installing, repairing or maintaining a lift used to help them move between floors

preparation and restoration of the immediately surrounding decor
