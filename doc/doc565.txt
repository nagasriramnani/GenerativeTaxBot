If a person lives for 7 years after making a gift, there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay.

Any gift a person continued to benefit from before they died also counts towards the value of an estate - for example, if they gave away a house but lived in it rent-free (known as a ‘gift with reservation’).

There’s no Inheritance Tax to pay on gifts to charities or political parties.
