Make an official demand for money you’re owed

You can use a statutory demand to ask for money you’re owed from a person or business.

If they ignore the statutory demand or cannot repay the money, you can apply to a court to:

make someone bankrupt - if you’re owed £5000 or more by an individual, including a sole trader or a member of a partnership

get a company wound up (liquidated) - if you and any other creditors are owed £750 or more

However, the costs are high and you may not get any of your money back. Get legal advice before doing this if you’re unsure.
