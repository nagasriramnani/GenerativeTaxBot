P60

Your P60 shows the tax you’ve paid on your salary in the tax year (6 April to 5 April). You get a separate P60 for each of your jobs every tax year.

There’s a separate guide to getting P60s if you’re an employer.

If you’re working for an employer on 5 April they must give you a P60. They must provide this by 31 May, on paper or electronically.

You’ll need your P60 to prove how much tax you’ve paid on your salary, for example:

to claim back overpaid tax

to apply for tax credits

as proof of your income if you apply for a loan or a mortgage
