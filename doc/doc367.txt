What bailiffs can and cannot take

If you let a bailiff into your home, they may take some of your belongings to sell.

Bailiffs can take luxury items, for example a TV or games console.

They cannot take:

things you need, such as your clothes, cooker or fridge

work tools and equipment which together are worth less than £1,350

someone else’s belongings, such as your partner’s computer

You’ll have to prove that someone else’s goods do not belong to you.

What bailiffs can charge

How much you pay depends on your situation. Citizens Advice has information on bailiffs’ fees.
