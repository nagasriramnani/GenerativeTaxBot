Your payments will protect:

your benefit entitlement if you return to the UK

your State Pension whether you choose to return to the UK or stay living abroad

Voluntary National Insurance contributions do not cover your health insurance in the country where you live.

Working in any other country

If you’re not covered by a social security agreement, you may need to pay social security contributions in the country you’re working in.

You’ll still need to pay National Insurance in the UK for the first 52 weeks of working abroad if you meet all of the following conditions:

you’re working abroad temporarily

your employer has a place of business in the UK

you’re ordinarily resident in the UK

you were living in the UK immediately before starting work abroad
