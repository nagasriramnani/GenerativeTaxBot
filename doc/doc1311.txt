Do not pay this way if you need to get probate (known as ‘confirmation’ in Scotland) quickly. (Probate is the right to deal with the deceased person’s property, money and possessions.)

After the money has been transferred

In England, Wales or Northern Ireland

HMRC will send your IHT421 form to the Probate Registry so they can send a grant of representation to you (if you’re handling probate yourself) or to your solicitor.

In Scotland

HMRC will return your C1 Confirmation form to you so you can apply for confirmation.

If the amount transferred is not enough to cover the Inheritance Tax you owe, HMRC will write to tell you how much to pay and how to pay it.
