Sending your return

File your tax return online or call HMRC and request form SA100.

Deadlines

Send your tax return by the deadline.

self-employed or a sole trader

not self-employed

registering a partner or partnership

Filling in your return

You need to keep records (for example bank statements or receipts) so you can fill in your tax return correctly.

You can get help filling in your return.
