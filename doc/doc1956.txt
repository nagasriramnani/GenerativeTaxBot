When an indirect disposal occurs

An indirect disposal occurs when a non-resident sells shares in a company that derives 75% or more of its gross asset value from UK land, and the person making the disposal has an investment of at least 25% in that company which holds UK land as an investment.

‘Connected persons’ (such as spouses, civil partners or some descendants) are also included when working out if a person has an investment of at least 25%. Find out more about the definition of a ‘connected person’ in CG73936 of the HMRC Capital Gains Manual.
