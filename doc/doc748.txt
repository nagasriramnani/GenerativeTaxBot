When bankruptcy ends

Your bankruptcy and the restrictions generally end when you’re ‘discharged’, which is usually automatic.

This is usually 12 months after the adjudicator made you bankrupt. It can be longer in some circumstances, for example if you do not co-operate with your trustee.

Check your discharge date online using the Individual Insolvency Register.

If you cancel your bankruptcy, all restrictions will end immediately and your details will be removed from the Individual Insolvency Register.
