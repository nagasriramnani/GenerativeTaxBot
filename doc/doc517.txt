VAT-inclusive and exclusive prices

You’ll need to work out the price including VAT when charging VAT on goods or services. You might also need to work out the amount of VAT you paid on goods you bought, if you plan to reclaim the VAT.

VAT-inclusive prices

To work out a price that includes the standard rate of VAT (20%), multiply the price excluding VAT by 1.2.

Example

You’re selling a chair for £60 and need to add 20% VAT to get the price including VAT.

60 x 1.2 = 72

The price including VAT is £72.

To work out a price that includes the reduced rate of VAT (5%), multiply the price excluding VAT by 1.05.

Example

You’re selling a child’s car seat for £200 and need to add 5% VAT to get the price including VAT.

200 x 1.05 = 210

The price including VAT is £210.
