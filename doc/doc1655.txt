Overview

VAT margin schemes tax the difference between what you paid for an item and what you sold it for, rather than the full selling price. You pay VAT at 16.67% (one-sixth) on the difference.

You can choose to use a margin scheme when you sell:

second-hand goods

works of art

antiques

collectors’ items

You cannot use a margin scheme for:

any item you bought for which you were charged VAT

precious metals

investment gold

precious stones

Example

You buy a work of art for £1,500 and sell it for £2,000. Using a margin scheme, you pay VAT at 16.67% (one-sixth) on the difference: £500. This means you’ll pay £83.33.
