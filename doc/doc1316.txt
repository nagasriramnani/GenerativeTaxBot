The extra pension you get from a contracted-out pension scheme is usually the same as, or more than, the Additional State Pension you would have got if you did not contract out.

Check if you were contracted out

You can find out if you were contracted out by:

checking an old payslip

calling your pension provider

The Pension Tracing Service might be able to find your pension providers’ contact details if you’ve lost contact with them.

National Insurance while contracting out

You paid lower National Insurance contributions while you were contracted out if:

you earned between £155 and £770 a week

you were under State Pension age

you did not pay reduced rate National Insurance

What happens when you retire

You’ll get a pension from your employer’s workplace pension scheme.
