You can then decide if you want the court to take further action to collect your payment.

You cannot enforce a judgement if you’re told that the person who owes you money has got a ‘Breathing Space’ and is temporarily protected from their creditors. Find out about your responsibilities and what you need to tell the court during a ‘Breathing Space’.

Send bailiffs to collect payment

You can ask the court to send bailiffs to collect the money. This is called a ‘warrant of control’.

The bailiff will ask for payment within 7 days. If the debt is not paid, the bailiff will visit the debtor’s home or business to see if anything can be sold to pay the debt.

You can apply to either a county court or the High Court if you’re owed between £600 and £5,000.
