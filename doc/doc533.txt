The remaining residence nil rate band of £75,000 is available to transfer to the husband’s estate. There’s no unused basic Inheritance Tax threshold to transfer.

Gifts and lifetime transfers

Unlike the basic Inheritance Tax threshold, the residence nil rate band does not apply to gifts and lifetime transfers, such as:

transfers into trusts

the value of any gifts made in the 7 years before the person that died gave them away (which are then taxable)

Example

A woman dies in tax year 2020 to 2021 and leaves to her daughter:

a house worth £200,000

other assets worth £250,000

During the 7 years before she died she gave assets worth £100,000 to her nephew.

The maximum available residence nil rate band in tax year 2020 to 2021 is £175,000.
