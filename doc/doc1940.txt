If you do not have a personal tax account

You need a Government Gateway user ID and password to set up a personal tax account. If you do not already have a user ID you can create one when you sign in for the first time.

Youâ€™ll need your National Insurance number or postcode and 2 of the following:

a valid UK passport

a UK photocard driving licence issued by the DVLA (or DVA in Northern Ireland)

a payslip from the last 3 months or a P60 from your employer for the last tax year

details of a tax credit claim if you made one

details from a Self Assessment tax return if you made one

information held on your credit record if you have one (such as loans, credit cards or mortgages)
