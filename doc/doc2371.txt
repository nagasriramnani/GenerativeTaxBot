You can also charge the reduced rate for extra work you need to do as part of the installation. But you must charge the standard rate of 20% on all work if the installation is just part of another, bigger job.

Example
You have to cut a new hatch in the ceiling to install loft insulation. Because you needed to do this as part of the insulation, you can charge reduced-rate VAT.

Example
You replace a roof with a new, insulated one. Because the insulation is just part of a bigger job, you have to charge the standard rate of 20% on the whole job.
