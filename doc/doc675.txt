Alternatives to payments on account

Monthly returns

If making payments on account and submitting quarterly VAT returns does not suit your business you can choose to make VAT returns and payments monthly. To make the change to monthly returns you can either:

apply online to change your registration details

fill in form VAT 484 and send it to the address on the form

You might have to continue making monthly returns for at least one year.

If you submit monthly VAT returns you may be allowed up to 7 extra days to pay and submit your VAT return, as long as you use an electronic payment method. This is the only circumstance that a business in a payments on account arrangement can be given the extension to the due date for payment.
