the name of your business

After you tell HMRC

You’ll get an email from HMRC to confirm that you’ve been recorded as operating under the Northern Ireland Protocol.

After you get the email, you’ll need to start using the XI prefix before your usual VAT number - for example, XI 123456789 instead of GB 123456789.

Using your XI VAT number

You must use your XI VAT number on all documentation when communicating with EU customers or suppliers (for example, on invoices).

If you’re selling goods from Northern Ireland to VAT-registered customers in the EU, complete an EC Sales List.

If you do not tell HMRC or use an XI VAT number, it could mean that you pay or charge the wrong VAT on goods.
