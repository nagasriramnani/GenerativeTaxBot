If a supplier issues you an incorrect invoice

If a supplier issues you an invoice where the amount to pay is wrong, you need to ask the supplier to correct it and issue a new invoice.

If you pay less than the amount due on an invoice, you can only reclaim the VAT on the amount paid - not what is on the invoice.

You cannot claim more VAT than is shown on a valid VAT invoice.

VAT account

You must keep a separate record of the VAT you charge and the VAT you pay on your purchases. This record is called a ‘VAT account’.

You use the figures in your VAT account to complete your VAT return.

There are not any rules on what a VAT account should look like, but it must show:

your total VAT sales

your total VAT purchases

the VAT you owe HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)
