Lower payments on account

If your total VAT liability (not including the VAT on imports and moving goods into and out of excise warehouses) is or will be less than 80% of the liability we used to calculate your current payments, you can ask us to reduce them. This applies to either:

any completed year ending after the year that we’ve based current payments on (a backward look at your VAT liability)

any year that’s started but not yet ended (a forward look and you must include an estimate of future returns you’ll submit to make up the whole year)

In both cases, write to the payments on account team.

Tell us the reasons we should reduce your payments. If we’re satisfied, we’ll change your payments to show your reduced VAT liability.
