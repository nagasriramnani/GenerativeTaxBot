Compare the value of the estate at the end of step 4 (the value of the estate that you’ll pay tax on known as the ‘chargeable estate’) with the available threshold at the end of step 5.

If the value of the estate is less than the available threshold at step 5, there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay. If it’s more, you pay Inheritance Tax on the excess.

Check that you’ve calculated and applied all relevant reliefs, exemptions and thresholds to the net value of the estate.

Once you’ve got all your information and figures together check if you need to send full details of the estate to HMRC.
