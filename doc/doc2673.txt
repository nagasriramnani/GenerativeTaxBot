What rate you’ll pay

The rate you pay depends on how the installation costs are split.

The total cost of installation is made up of two parts:

the cost of the products

the cost of the labour

If the cost of the products (not including VAT) is 60% or less of the total cost of the installation (not including VAT), you’ll pay 5% VAT on everything.

If the products cost more than 60% of the total cost of installation, you’ll only pay 5% VAT on the labour. You’ll pay the standard rate of 20% VAT for the products.

Example - insulation materials are 60% or less of the total cost of installation
