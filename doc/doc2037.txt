If the person who died did not use their residence nil rate band, you can transfer the unused threshold to a surviving spouse or civil partner.

Find out how to qualify for residence nil rate band

To qualify, the person who died must have left their home, or a share of it, to their direct descendants.

A person does not have to leave the whole of the home to direct descendants. If they only inherit a share of the home, you calculate the available residence nil rate band on the basis of the value of that share.

The estate may also qualify if the person downsized to a lower value property, or sold or gave away their home on or after 8 July 2015.

Example

A woman dies in tax year 2020 to 2021. Her estate includes a home worth Â£500,000.
