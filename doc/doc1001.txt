With services, deciding the place of supply can be complicated. There are various rules that apply, depending on:

whether you’ve more than one business location

the kind of service you give

the place where your business or your business customer ‘belongs’

Which country’s VAT rules to use when charging VAT on services

If you’re in the UK and the place of supply of your service is in the UK, you charge and account for VAT according to UK VAT rules.

If you’re in the UK and the place of supply of your service is in an EU country, you do not pay UK VAT.

But for some supplies, you may need to register and account for VAT in the country of supply.
