You’ll need your National Insurance number.

HMRC can only discuss your claim with you or someone you have authorised as your representative. A partner or someone else can get general advice but they must be authorised to discuss a claim.

Before you call

This helpline may ask you some security questions. Make sure your personal details and address are up to date in your personal tax account or you could fail telephone security. If you do not already have a personal tax account, you can set one up.

When you call

This helpline uses speech recognition software, so you will be asked why you are calling HMRC. Try to answer with short phrases and words, for example:

‘change my address’

‘question about claiming Child Benefit’

‘I can no longer claim Child Benefit’
