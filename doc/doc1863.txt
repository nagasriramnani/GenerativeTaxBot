sold it for less than it was worth to someone who’s unable to claim allowances

If you originally claimed 100% of the item

Add the full value to your profits in your tax return if both of the following apply:

you originally claimed 100% of the item under annual investment allowance (AIA) or first year allowances

you have nothing in the pool your item qualifies for

This is known as a ‘balancing charge’.

If you have a balance in the pool your item qualifies for

Deduct the full value from that pool if you originally claimed 100% of the item and you have a balance in the pool your item qualifies for.

Add the difference to your profits in your tax return if the value of the item is more than the amount in your pool. This is a ‘balancing charge’.
