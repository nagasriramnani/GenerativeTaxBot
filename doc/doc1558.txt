other benefits like Guardian’s Allowance

Child Benefit proves you (or your partner) support another child. You may pay less child maintenance for children not living with you.

You can make a new claim or just protect your entitlement to the above by:

sending a Child Benefit claim form

ticking the option to ‘not have the benefit paid’

A partner moves in or out

Your situation may change if your adjusted net income is more than £50,000 and you move in or split up with someone who’s getting Child Benefit.

You’ll have to pay the tax charge if your adjusted net income is more than £50,000 and higher than your new partner’s adjusted net income. Your partner pays it if their adjusted net income is higher.
