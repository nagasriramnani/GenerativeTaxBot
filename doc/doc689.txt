Get your SA302 tax calculation

You can get evidence of your earnings (‘SA302’) for the last 4 years once you’ve sent your Self Assessment tax return.

You can also get a tax year overview for any year.

You might be asked for these documents as evidence of your income, for example if you’re applying for a mortgage and you’re self-employed.

The tax year is from 6 April to 5 April the following year.

Printing your documents

You can print your own tax calculation and tax year overview if you do your Self Assessment tax return using either:

HM Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC’s) online services

commercial software

Check that your mortgage provider accepts documents you’ve printed yourself.

You cannot print your documents until 72 hours after you sent your tax return.
