Setting up a self-billing arrangement

If one of your customers wants to set up a self-billing arrangement with you, they’ll ask you to agree to this in writing. If you agree, they’ll give you a self-billing agreement to sign.

The terms of the agreement are a matter between you and your customer, but there are certain conditions you’ll both have to meet to make sure you comply with VAT regulations.

For VAT purposes you’ll have to do all of the following:

sign and keep a copy of the self-billing agreement

agree not to issue any sales invoices to your customer for any transaction during the period of the agreement

agree to accept the self-billing invoices that your customer issues
