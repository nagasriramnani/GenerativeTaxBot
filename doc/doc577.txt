The closing balance in this pool is £8,200 (£10,000 minus £1,800). This is the starting balance for the next year.

Items you use privately that are not in a single asset pool

If you start using something outside your business that you’ve already claimed capital allowances on:

add the market value of the item (the amount you’d expect to sell it for) to a single asset pool

deduct the same amount from the pool it was in

If the amount you deduct is more than the balance in the pool, the difference is a ‘balancing charge’ - you must put it on your tax return.

Claiming less than you’re entitled to

You do not have to claim the full amount you’re entitled to. If you only claim part, the rest stays in your closing balance.

If you have £1,000 or less in your pool
